Team Sharing
-------------------------------

We saw how to share individual documents with other users in the
[Sharing](sharing.md) article.  Team sites give your further control,
allowing you to share collections of documents in whole or in part
with others.
To share a team site, open the user menu by clicking on the circle with your profile picture or initials
on the top right of the screen.  Then select the "Manage Users"
option.

You can now invite people just as you did for individual documents in
[Sharing](sharing.md).

Just as for documents, you can invite people as viewers, editors, or owners of the
team site.  All documents within the site will be accessible to those people,
unless you turn off the "Inherit access" sharing option for individual [workspaces](workspaces.md)
or [documents](sharing.md).

## Roles

There are three primary roles supported by Grist for team sites:

- **Viewer**: allows a user to view the site but not make any changes to it.
  A viewer will be allowed to view all workspaces and documents within the site
  unless otherwise specified.

- **Editor**: allows a user to view or make changes to the site and all its workspaces
  and documents (unless otherwise specified).  However, the sharing settings for the
  site, its workspaces, and its documents cannot be changed by an editor.

- **Owner**: gives a user complete permissions to the site's workspaces and documents,
  including their sharing settings.

## Billing Permissions
None of these roles give access to billing information or management.
Billing managers can be added via the "Billing Account" option. 
Click on the circle with your profile picture or initial
on the top right of the screen, and select "Billing Account".
