# Record Cards

Record Cards are a quick, easy way to view a record's details. 

To view a record's details as a card, hover over the row number and click the arrow icon that appears. Select 'View as card' from the drop-down menu.

This opens an editable card view of the record's details.

If your table contains a [reference or reference list column](col-refs.md), you can click the link icon to open the linked record's card.

A record card will open to display record data for the referenced record.
