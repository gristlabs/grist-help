# More Examples

Here we will post useful examples of what you can do with Grist, sometimes with
ready-to-use templates.

- [Slicing and Dicing Credit Card Expenses](examples/2020-06-credit-card.md):
  Grist offers a handy way to explore your credit card transactions quickly. American
  Express card members can use the ready-made template in the example.

- [Book Lists with Library and Store Look-ups](examples/2020-06-book-club.md):
  Grist's link handling and formulas can help you with your book club, by
  adding automatic links to libraries, stores, review sites, and other references.
  The same ideas could work with Ikea furniture, food orders, whatever you like.

- [Prepare Emails using Formulas](examples/2020-07-email-compose.md):
  Turn cells into links that open an email program to compose a new message, and prefill its
  recipients, subject, and more.

- [Preparing Invoices](examples/2020-08-invoices.md):
  Preview printable invoices side by side with your client data.

- [Tracking Payroll](examples/2020-09-payroll.md):
  Keep track of employee rates, roles, and hours conveniently, with up-to-date reliable payroll
  summaries, and detailed history.

- [Print Mailing Labels](examples/2020-10-print-labels.md):
  Print mailing labels easily. A custom widget supporting popular label sizes makes it quick to
  generate labels and print from Grist.

- [Treasure Hunt](examples/2020-11-treasure-hunt.md):
  Plan a treasure hunt without losing track. Brainstorm clues, then assemble them into a
  consistent trail.

- [Map](examples/2020-12-map.md):
  Show locations listed in a table on a map.

- [Task Management for Teams](examples/2021-01-tasks.md):
  This glorified To-Do list -- similar to the one we use internally at Grist labs -- works well to
  manage a team's tasks.

  A very simple list of leads, assigned to individuals to follow up, with control
  of assignments reserved for document owners.
