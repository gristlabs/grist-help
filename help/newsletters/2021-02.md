## Quick Tips

- <a name="totals"></a>
  **Totals.** To compute totals of a column, spreadsheet users will often reach for the last row
  of their table to enter a formula there. In Grist, every row is a database record, including the
  last row. But totals are certainly available!

    Instead of adding a row for totals, add a one-line summary table. Click the "Add New" button,
    and select "Add Widget to Page". In the dialog that opens, click the summation icon
    (<span class="grist-icon" style="--icon: var(--icon-Pivot)"></span>) next to the table you'd like
    totals for:

    <span class="screenshot-large">*![Summary Dialog](../images/newsletters/2021-02/summary-picker.png)*</span>
    {: .screenshot-half }

    Click "Add to Page", and you'll see a one-line summary of your table. Use the drag handle just to
    the left of the title to move it below your table (where you normally expect totals).

    <span class="screenshot-large">*![Drag Totals](../images/newsletters/2021-02/drag-totals.png)*</span>
    {: .screenshot-half }

    Grist creates sums of all numeric columns automatically. You can remove any you don't need,
    add new ones, or edit ones for which you need something other than sum (perhaps `AVERAGE`, `MAX`,
    or an entirely custom Python calculation).

    <span class="screenshot-large">*![Totals Row](../images/newsletters/2021-02/totals-row.png)*</span>
      {: .screenshot-half }

    Read [Summary tables](../summary-tables.md) for more on summary tables and their many uses.

- <a name="realtime-sharing"></a>
  **Real-time Sharing.** Even on the free plan, you can share a document and collaborate on it.
  Any change that you or another editor makes will immediately show up on the other person's screen.

    To share a document, click the sharing icon
    (<span class="grist-icon" style="--icon: var(--icon-Share)"></span>), and select "Manage Users".

    In the dialog that opens, type in the email address of the person to invite. Change their role
    from Viewer to Editor if you'd like to give them editing permission. Then click Confirm. Your
    collaborator now has access to your document, and Grist will send them an email with a link to
    it.

## What's New

Grist mobile support has come a long way recently, and we are happy to say that you can now use
Grist quite comfortably in mobile browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

On small screens, you can find the list of pages from the button in the bottom bar:

  ![Mobile Pages](../images/newsletters/2021-02/mobile-pages.png)

For pages with multiple widgets, only the active widget is expanded. Other widgets are collapsed
until you touch to expand them:

  ![Mobile Widgets](../images/newsletters/2021-02/mobile-widgets.png)

To edit a cell, simply double-tap it.

Mobile support is still a work in progress. To get back to the desktop version on a mobile device,
open your account menu, and select "Toggle Mobile Mode" option:

  *![toggle-mobile-mode](../images/toggle-mobile-mode.png)*
  {: .screenshot-half }

Please report any issues, and share suggestions for improvements!
