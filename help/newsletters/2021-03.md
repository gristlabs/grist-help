## Access rules

Grist now offers "access rules" for fine-grained control of who can
see (or edit) which parts of your document at the table, column, and
row level. In December, we invited those interested in early access
to try the feature out. We've made a lot of improvements, and are
now excited to open the feature to the public.

![Access rules page](../images/newsletters/2021-03/access-rules-page.png)

Things to know about access rules:

- Until now, everyone you share a document with sees the same content.  Now, their
  views can be filtered.  For example, a table or column may be visible only
  to certain users.  Or some users may see only rows that meet a condition.

- Until now, all editors and owners of a document could change anything about its
  content.  Now, document owners can control what specific editors can change.
  For example, a table or column may be locked for certain editors.  Or some
  editors may only update, add, or remove rows that meet a condition.

- If you need it, editors can be organized into groups or teams using
  a table within the document itself, and granted permissions
  systematically.

- You can make special links to give ad-hoc view access to pieces of the document,
  including documents shared with the public.

Access rules are marked as a Beta feature, meaning that the design of
access rules is likely to evolve, and sometimes that will require
updates to documents that use them. We wonâ€™t make such changes
lightly.
