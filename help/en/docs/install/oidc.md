OpenID Connect {: .tag-core .tag-ee }
====

Configuration for OIDC, useful for organization single-sign-on logins.
A good informative overview of OIDC is at <https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc>

Note:

  * SP is "Service Provider", in our case, the Grist application.
  * IdP is the "Identity Provider", somewhere users log into, e.g. Keycloak, Authelia, ...
  * OIDC is the acronym for OpenID Connect

Expected environment variables:

  * `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_ISSUER` - the issuer URL for the IdP, passed to node-openid-client, see: <https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/blob/a84d022f195f82ca1c97f8f6b2567ebcef8738c3/docs/README.md#issuerdiscoverissuer>.
    **This variable turns on the OIDC login system.**
  * `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_CLIENT_ID` - the client ID for the application, as registered with the IdP.
  * `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_CLIENT_SECRET` - the client secret for the application, as registered with the IdP.
  * `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SCOPES` (optional) - the scopes to request from the IdP, as a space-separated list. Defaults to `"openid email profile"`.
  * `GRIST_OIDC_SP_HOST` (optional) - this is just the base URL of the Grist site,
    such as `https://<grist-domain>` (when OIDC is active, there will
	be a `/oauth2/callback` endpoint available here for implementing the protocol).
	If omitted, `APP_HOME_URL` will be used.
  * `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_END_SESSION_ENDPOINT` (optional) - If set, overrides the IdP's `end_session_endpoint` with
    an alternative URL to redirect user upon logout (for an IdP that has a logout endpoint but does not support
    the OIDC RP-Initiated Logout specification).
  * `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SKIP_END_SESSION_ENDPOINT` (optional) -  If set to "true", on logout, there won't be
    any attempt to call the IdP's `end_session_endpoint` (the user will remain logged in in the IdP).
    You should only set it to "true" if the IdP does not provide such endpoint (for example if you use Gitlab).
  * `GRIST_OIDC_SP_PROFILE_NAME_ATTR` (optional) - The key of the attribute to use for the user's name. If omitted,
    the name will be the concatenation of `given_name` + `family_name` if they are provided or the `name` attribute otherwise.
  * `GRIST_OIDC_SP_PROFILE_EMAIL_ATTR` (optional) - The key of the attribute to use for the user's email. Defaults to "email".
  * `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_ENABLED_PROTECTIONS` (optional) - A comma-separated list of protections to enable. Supported values are `PKCE`, `STATE`, `NONCE`.
    Defaults to `PKCE,STATE`, which is the recommended settings. It's highly recommended that you enable `STATE`,
    and at least one of `PKCE` or `NONCE,` depending on what your OIDC provider requires/supports.
  * `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_ACR_VALUES` (optional) - A space-separated list of ACR values to request from the IdP.
  * `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_EXTRA_CLIENT_METADATA` (optional) - A JSON object with extra client metadata to pass to openid-client.
    Be aware that setting this object may override any other values passed to the openid client.

## Example: Gitlab

See [how to create an OAuth2 application in Gitlab in this documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html). While creating the application, set the redirect URI to `https://<grist-domain>/oauth2/callback` (or `http://localhost:8484/oauth2/callback` if tested locally, change `8484` to the port you listen on) and select the scopes you will specify in `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SCOPES`.

Once the application is set up, start Grist with these settings:

```shell
GRIST_OIDC_SP_HOST=https://<grist-domain> # or http://localhost:8484
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_ISSUER=https://gitlab.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SCOPES=openid profile email

# the client ID generated by Gitlab for the application
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_CLIENT_ID=...

# the client secret generated by Gitlab for the application
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_CLIENT_SECRET=...

# Gitlab doesn't propose `end_session_endpoint`
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SKIP_END_SESSION_ENDPOINT=true
```

This format is suitable for an `.env` file or similar. From a shell invocation, remember to quote values with spaces, such as `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SCOPES="openid profile email"`.

## Example: Auth0

Create an application in Auth0 [as explained in this documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications) (you can select the app type named `Regular Web Applications`). Once the application is created, ensure to add at least the following configuration for the app:

 * Allowed callback URLs: `https://<grist-domain>/oauth2/callback`
 * Allowed logout URLs: `http://<grist-domain>/*` (you can also replace the wildcard with the whole path in order to be stricter)

Then you should be able to start Grist with the following settings:

```shell
GRIST_OIDC_SP_HOST=https://<grist-domain> # or http://localhost:8484
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_ISSUER=https://<your-auth0-app-domain>
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SCOPES=openid profile email

# the client ID generated by Auth0 for the application
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_CLIENT_ID=...

# the client secret generated by Auth0 for the application
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

This format is suitable for an `.env` file or similar. From a shell invocation, remember to quote values with spaces, such as `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SCOPES="openid profile email"`.

## Example: Keycloak

First of all, set up Keycloak as explained in one of these "Getting started" guides: <https://www.keycloak.org/guides#getting-started>.

Once keycloak is set up with a realm and a user, create a new client with the following configuration:

 - Client type: OpenID Connect
 - Authentication flow: Standard Flow
 - Root URL: `https://<grist-domain>`
 - Valid redirect URIs: `/oauth2/callback`
 - Valid post logout redirect URIs: `/*` (you can also replace the wildcard with the whole path in order to be stricter)

Submit your settings and go to the Credentials tab to retrieve the client secret.

Then, you can start Grist with the following configuration:

```shell
GRIST_OIDC_SP_HOST=https://<grist-domain> # or http://localhost:8484
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_ISSUER=https://<keycloak-domain>/realms/<your-realm>
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SCOPES=openid profile email

# the ID you chose for the Keycloak client
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_CLIENT_ID=...

# the client secret generated by Keycloak retrieved earlier
GRIST_OIDC_IDP_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

This format is suitable for an `.env` file or similar. From a shell invocation, remember to quote values with spaces, such as `GRIST_OIDC_IDP_SCOPES="openid profile email"`.
