## Creating document tours in Grist

Document tours in Grist can provide a step-by-step guide to help users navigate and understand how to use your document. While not a built-in feature, you can add document tours to any Grist document by creating a specially configured table named `GristDocTour`.

### What is a document tour?

A document tour displays tooltips on specific pages or cells in your document, helping guide users through its layout and purpose. This can be especially helpful for onboarding new users or explaining more complex workflows. Many of the templates in our [Template Gallery](https://public.getgrist.com/p/templates) have document tours. We'll use the [Flashcards](https://templates.getgrist.com/keLK5sVeyfPk/Flashcards) template as an example as we go through the steps to build a document tour below.

## How to create a document tour

### **Step One:** Add the `GristDocTour` table

Create a new table in your document by clicking the green 'Add New' button then 'Add Empty Table'. Name the new table `GristDocTour`.

<span class="screenshot-large">*![add-doc-tour-table](images/document-tours/add-doc-tour-table.png)*</span>

### **Step Two:** Add the following columns to the `GristDocTour` table

1. **Title:** Text column for the tooltip header.
2. **Body:** Text column for the tooltip content.
3. **Placement:** Text column indicating tooltip position relative to the target (e.g., top, right).  [https://popper.js.org/](https://popper.js.org/){:target="\_blank"} has an interactive tool that shows how this works.
- **Location:** Formula column with the formula `SELF_HYPERLINK() + $Location_Cell`.
<span class="screenshot-large">*![location-formula](images/document-tours/location-formula.png)*</span>
- **Location Cell:** Text column containing the [anchor link](#step-three-add-your-anchor-links) of the target cell (e.g., /p/8#a1.s21.r1.c7).
<span class="screenshot-large">*![location-cell](images/document-tours/location-cell.png)*</span>
- **Link URL (optional):** Text column for an additional link in the tooltip.
- **Link Text (optional):** Text column for the display text of the link.
- **Link Icon (optional):** Text column specifying an icon to display before the link. Available icons are listed [here](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/blob/main/app/client/ui2018/IconList.ts).

### **Step Three:** Add your anchor links

Your document tour can point to specific cells and pages using anchor links.

You can copy an anchor link to a cell by pressing <code class="keys">*âŒ˜* *â‡§* *A*</code> (Mac) or <code class="keys">*Ctrl* + *Shift* + *A*</code> (Windows) while the cell is selected. This option is also available via the [row menu](widget-table.md#row-operations) as "Copy anchor link." The link will be placed in your clipboard, ready to paste into the **Location Cell** column.

<span class="screenshot-large">*![copy-anchor-link](images/document-tours/copy-anchor-link.png)*</span>
{: .screenshot-half }

Use <code class="keys">*âŒ˜* + *V*</code> (Mac) or <code class="keys">*Ctrl* + *V*</code> (Windows) to paste the anchor link into the **Location Cell** column of your `GristDocTour` table. You'll want to delete everything prior to `/p/`.

For example, if your anchor link is:

`https://templates.getgrist.com/keLK5sVeyfPk/Flashcards/p/8#a1.s21.r1.c39`

...delete everything except

`/p/8#a1.s21.r1.c39`

<span class="screenshot-large">*![anchor-link-cell](images/document-tours/anchor-link-cell.png)*</span>

To place the document tour popup on a specific page, you can simply copy the end of the URL that contains the page number, `/p/#`, and paste this into the **Location Cell** column of your `GristDocTour` table.

<span class="screenshot-large">*![url-page](images/document-tours/url-page.png)*</span>
{: .screenshot-half }

<span class="screenshot-large">*![anchor-link-page](images/document-tours/anchor-link-page.png)*</span>

!!! note "Navigating back to the `GristDocTour` table"
    If you click away from your table, perhaps to obtain an anchor link, it is always accessible under [Raw Data](raw-data.md).

### **Step Four:** Reviewing your document tour

When initially creating your document tour, it is useful to see the popups and quickly make any changes. In a single window, that requires a lot of clicking back and forth. Open your document in two browser windows. In one window, pull up the `GristDocTour` table under [Raw Data](raw-data.md). In the other window, view your document tour on demand by clicking 'Tour of this Document' at the bottom of the left-hand navigation panel.

<span class="screenshot-large">*![reviewing-doc-tour](images/document-tours/reviewing-doc-tour.png)*</span>

### **Step Five:** Sharing your document tour

To share your document tour, simply share your document. The document tour will start automatically the first time a user accesses the document. After that, they can access the tour at anytime by clicking 'Tour of this Document' at the bottom of the left-hand navigation panel.

<span class="screenshot-large">*![tour-of-this-document](images/document-tours/tour-of-this-document.png)*</span>
{: .screenshot-half }

!!! note "ðŸ’¡ Tip:"
    When sharing a URL to your document, you can force the document tour to appearâ€”regardless of whether the user has seen it beforeâ€”by appending `#repeat-doc-tour` to the end of the URL.
