# Plugin API

The plugin API is used in custom widgets to interact with the document
within which the widget is embedded.

If you haven't already, be sure to read our
[summary of Custom Widgets](../widget-custom.md) and look at the
[grist-widget repository](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget)
for examples of widget implementations.

Here you can find a reference for functions and interfaces available
to custom widgets, starting with the [grist](modules/grist_plugin_api.md) object.
