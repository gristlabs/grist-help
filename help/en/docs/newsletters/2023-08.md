## Work at Grist

## What's New

### Grist CSV Viewer

![Grist CSV Viewer](../images/newsletters/2023-08/grist-csv-editor.png)

Another month, another exciting update ‚Äì this time for the venerable file format we all know and love, the `.csv`. The [Grist CSV Viewer](https://www.getgrist.com/grist-csv-viewer/){:target="\_blank"} is a free tool that gives CSVs the power of Grist on the web. No more downloading and opening CSVs in an external app, now you can preview and interact with CSVs in a Grist-powered spreadsheet!

The viewer is open source, supports features like filtering, sorting, copy/pasting, and even formulas. And it's easy to install, with just two lines of HTML added to any website.

[See it in action](https://www.getgrist.com/grist-csv-viewer/){:target="\_blank"}
{: .grist-button}

### AI Assistant ‚Äì Support for Llama

Grist self-hosters can now use the [Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/){:target="\_blank"} family of self-hostable models via the [llama2-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python){:target="\_blank"} wrapper by configuring the expanded [AI Assistant-related environment variables](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core#ai-formula-assistant-related-variables-all-optional){:target="\_blank"}.

### ùì¢ùìΩùîÇùìµùìÆùì≠ column headers

![Example of styled column headers](../images/newsletters/2023-08/styled-header.png)

You can now style column headers! [Look!](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#formatting-columns){:target="\_blank"} (Thanks to @CamilleLegeron and the ANCT for the PR.)

### `.grist` file download options

You can now download a `.grist` file's structure without any data, which is useful for templating. Or you can download a `.grist` without document history which reduces file size.

In our tests, we‚Äôve seen documents go from 10.8mb to 1.5mb after omitting file history. üò≤

### File importing redesign

File importing has been updated with a new flow, with better support for multiple files/sheets and column mapping.

## More Improvements

- Grist has been upgraded from Python 3.9 to 3.11. This update brings with it the following new features:
    - Execution should be slightly faster.
    - Additional support for the [statistics module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html){:target="\_blank"}, including `covariance`, `correlation`, and `linear_regression` functions.
    - Support for [Structural Pattern Matching](https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/){:target="\_blank"}.
    - You can now see `^` marks pointing at the problem in tracebacks, which can help debugging errors.
- Links are now clickable in [widget](https://support.getgrist.com/page-widgets/#renaming-widgets){:target="\_blank"} and [column description](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#renaming-columns){:target="\_blank"} tooltips.
- Grid selection now supports `CTRL/CMD+Shift+<arrow>` shortcuts. If you've used this shortcut in other popular spreadsheet products, you'll be right at home! (Thanks to @Ocarthon for contributing to this!)

## Learning Grist

### Webinar: Deconstructing the Payroll Template

In September we‚Äôll rebuild our [Payroll Template](https://templates.getgrist.com/5pHLanQNThxk/Payroll/p/2). This template uses formulas to look up hourly rates based on person, role, and date. You'll also learn how to build dynamic summary dashboards that summarize data by categories and let you drill into the records in those categories.

**Thursday September 21st at 3:00pm US Eastern Time.**

[SIGN UP FOR SEPTEMBER'S WEBINAR](https://www.getgrist.com/webinars/webinar-payroll-template/?utm_source=support-newsletter&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=build-webinar&utm_term=september-2023){:target="\_blank"}
{: .grist-button}

### Deconstructing the Class Enrollment Template

When looking at our templates you may wonder why templates are structured in a particular way. In August we rebuilt our [Class Enrollment template](https://templates.getgrist.com/doc/afterschool-program). This template uses reference columns to relate data in five different tables. Learn when to use reference columns, in which direction, and how to use helper tables to better structure your data.

## Templates

### Proposals & Contracts

Natalie has created a [detailed tutorial](https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2023-07-proposals-contracts/){:target="\_blank"} showing how this (very advanced) template was created. We actually use a version of this very template at Grist to handle contracts, so it‚Äôs tried and tested!

Not only can this template be used to generate printable contracts with dynamic content, it can also generate contract templates *themselves*. So you can have several versions of dynamic contracts created from the same Grist document. ü§Ø
