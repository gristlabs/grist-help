## What's new

### GristCon 2025  - save the date!

![GristCon teaser](../images/newsletters/2025-06/gristcon.png)

We‚Äôll have more to share soon, but we‚Äôre hosting a community-focused **virtual, one-day event on Thursday, September 18, 2025**. We‚Äôre still ironing out the details, but you can look forward to sessions from Grist Labs‚Äô best and brightest, and maybe even a peek behind the curtain. ü´£

Our community regularly impresses us with cool custom widgets, templates, and workflows. Have something you'd like to showcase? We'd love to have you present! Register [here](https://www.getgrist.com/gristcon-2025/){:target="\_blank"}.

### Weekly Grist 101 webinars starting July 9th

Our Grist 101 webinars have quickly become our most popular, and in response we‚Äôve started hosting more and more of them. But that‚Äôs still not enough, so now we‚Äôre hosting **weekly Grist 101 webinars** that will feature live chat with Natalie. These sessions will also run at more times of day and days of the week than we‚Äôve been able to previously, so if you‚Äôve been unable to join one of our sessions, check our upcoming schedule and sign up [here](https://www.getgrist.com/webinars/grist-101-new-users-guide/){:target="\_blank"}.

### Assistant updates!

![Assistant updates](../images/newsletters/2025-06/ai-updates2.gif)

We‚Äôve updated [Grist‚Äôs AI Assistant](https://www.getgrist.com/ai-assistant/){:target="\_blank"}, giving it even more power when working with Grist‚Äôs *own* powerful, yet unique, structure. It can now:

* Set column header and default cell styles (text, fill, font)
* Set cell formatting for Text, Numeric, Integer, and Toggle columns, including things like currency, min/max decimals, and date formats
* Modify choices (values and formatting)
* Wrap columns and set text alignment
* ...and more ‚Äì with more to come in the future

### Community widget tracker

[![Community widget tracker](../images/newsletters/2025-06/widget-repo.gif)](https://grist-marketing.getgrist.com/oHQcp1bG7DS8/Community-Widgets/p/4){:target="\_blank"}

Hi, Nick here. I write the newsletter and get to play around with all the new widgets people share. Recently, Heloise_Ouvry shared a [community-led document](https://community.getgrist.com/t/gristhub-your-new-hub-for-templates-and-widgets/8456/7){:target="\_blank"} collecting existing custom widgets, which is a great idea. In the *very same week*, I was working on sharing Grist Labs‚Äô own collection of community contributions, which you can now find [here](https://grist-marketing.getgrist.com/oHQcp1bG7DS8/Community-Widgets/p/4){:target="\_blank"}. Please take a look, and feel free to submit your own widgets in the linked form!

### External attachments for all

![External attachments](../images/newsletters/2025-06/external-attachments.png)

We released external attachments [back in February](https://support.getgrist.com/newsletters/2025-02/#external-attachment-storage){:target="\_blank"} for self-hosters, but it‚Äôs now available for all users! Learn all about external attachments in the [Help Center](https://support.getgrist.com/document-settings/#external-attachments){:target="\_blank"}. 

### More!

* Last month we shared a walkthrough of how to create [document tours](https://support.getgrist.com/document-tours/){:target="\_blank"}, and now Natalie has provided everyone with a brand new tutorial on how to create [document tutorials](https://support.getgrist.com/document-tutorials/){:target="\_blank"}, just like the one new users get when they first sign up! Bespoke onboarding is within your grasp.
* Having relationship problems? No, not that kind ‚Äì data relationship problems. Anais is here to help, with a brand new, **mega-sized spreadsheet makeover** which is the best example yet of how Grist can make the most of relations and references. [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0mWeWe5GBI&feature=youtu.be){:target="\_blank"}, and like and subscribe if you‚Äôre so inclined. 

![grist-core release](../images/newsletters/core-release.png)

There‚Äôs a new `grist-core` release, and its name is [v1.6.1](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases/tag/v1.6.1){:target="\_blank"}. Selected notes:

* Grist now automatically checks for upgrades by default on the `gristlabs/grist` and `gristlabs/grist-ee` Docker images.
* Python 2 support is gone for good. ü•≤ The smiling-with-tear emote is appropriate ‚Äì it was a good run.

## Community highlights

* Emmanuel Pelletier has completed another very useful [accessibility change](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/pull/1529){:target="\_blank"}, addressing choice token colors on both light and dark themes.
![Choice colors](../images/newsletters/2025-06/choice-color-themes.gif)
* La Suite hosted [Hack Days 2025](https://hackdays.numerique.gouv.fr/){:target="\_blank"}, a 50+ team hackathon that featured some impressive Grist-related entries, including:
  - [AirGrist](https://github.com/reedery/airgrist){:target="\_blank"}, a tool designed to help migrate Airtable bases to Grist. It even features a classic step-by-step wizard! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  - [Grist ‚ù§Ô∏è AI](https://github.com/suitenumerique/hackdays2025/tree/main/submissions/grist-3-ia){:target="\_blank"} (pictured below), an AI chatbot implementation in Grist using La Suite‚Äôs [Albert AI API](https://alliance.numerique.gouv.fr/albert/){:target="\_blank"}.
![Grist ‚ù§Ô∏è AI](../images/newsletters/2025-06/grist-heart-ai.png)
* Pierre_Camilleri shared an impressive [table schema validator custom widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/new-widget-for-table-schema-validation-in-grist-beta/10213){:target="\_blank"} that can take a JSON schema and highlight invalid cells while providing error messages. Not a simple task!
![Table schema validator custom widget](../images/newsletters/2025-06/schema-validation.png)
* This month QazCetelic surprised us with a custom Rust API-powered [Grist Image Optimizer](https://github.com/QazCetelic/grist-image-optimizer){:target="\_blank"}, which is a tool that does exactly what it sounds like. It converts large image attachments into more efficient formats (WEBP) to dramatically reduce image size (at the cost of some detail, naturally). Just look:
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 75%;">![Grist Image Optimizer](../images/newsletters/2025-06/gio.png)</span>
{: .screenshot-half }

* As part of his very useful work on [Pygrister](https://community.getgrist.com/t/pygrister-a-python-client-for-the-grist-api/5015/16){:target="\_blank"}, Riccardo_Polignieri has also created a Python Grist CLI tool he delightfully calls [Gry](https://github.com/ricpol/pygrister?tab=readme-ov-file#gry-the-grist-cli-tool){:target="\_blank"}. The tool is very welcome as a Python counterpart to [GristCTL](https://github.com/Ville-Eurometropole-Strasbourg/grist-ctl){:target="\_blank"} (written in Go), but it also lets you think and say the word ‚ÄúGry‚Äù. Gry gry gry gry gry.
* Arthur‚Äôs thread on [Advanced Monitoring in the Community Forum](https://community.getgrist.com/t/advanced-monitoring-for-grist-core/10265){:target="\_blank"} is a superbly detailed look at a handcrafted Grist monitoring solution for a specific use case.
* One of the new widgets discovered in updating the [new widget tracking document](https://grist-marketing.getgrist.com/oHQcp1bG7DS8/Community-Widgets/p/4){:target="\_blank"} was this all-in-one interface for managing table data, fittingly called the [Dynamic Multi-Table Editor](https://github.com/gristgouv/mae-custom-widgets/tree/main/multi-table-editor){:target="\_blank"}. Thanks to Amandine_Dugrain from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs!
