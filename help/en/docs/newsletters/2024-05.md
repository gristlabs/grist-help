## What's New

### New Grist Business plan

We‚Äôve been working hard to make sure Grist suits larger teams with complex and sensitive data. To address this segment, we‚Äôve updated our [Pricing page](https://www.getgrist.com/pricing/){:target="\_blank"} to include a new Business plan ‚Äî with a Self-Managed flavor! We‚Äôre hoping this new plan increases the transparency of pricing around Grist deployments that could use more of our support, rather than requiring organizations to reach out directly for pricing info.

There‚Äôs also a new option to subscribe annually. New Pro subscriptions are now $10 on the monthly plan, but still at $8 if paying annually. Existing Pro subscriptions are not affected by this change.

We‚Äôve also updated our [Professional Services page](https://www.getgrist.com/professional-services/){:target="\_blank"} to include some new opportunities we have regarding getting expert help building Grist documents.

### Formula timer

![Grist formula timer](../images/newsletters/2024-05/formula-timer.gif)

Enough is enough ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to put your formulas through their paces. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚è±Ô∏è

It‚Äôs a common event to see a spreadsheet collapse under its own weight, like a dying star composed of conditionals. Even mighty Grist documents can slow down when the power of Python goes unchecked. But now there‚Äôs a way to diagnose your formulas before things go supernova. Introducing the [formula timer](https://support.getgrist.com/formula-timer/){:target="\_blank"}, which lets you time formulas for specific changes or for a full document reload.

For more information, read all about [saving milliseconds with the formula timer](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/optimizing-formulas-with-grists-new-formula-timer/){:target="\_blank"} ‚Äî written by one of the newest additions to the Grist Labs team, Jordan! üëã

### Ordering conditional styles (with bonus draggability)

![Draggable conditions](../images/newsletters/2024-05/draggable-conditions.gif)

You can now easily reorder conditional styles, on both rows and columns! Don‚Äôt ask how this was accomplished previously!

### Self-hosting Admin Panel improvements

![Self-hosters Admin Panel improvements](../images/newsletters/2024-05/admin-console.gif)

Our new Admin Panel is continuing to grow and develop as we work towards our ambitions of easier self-hosting. üîú

* The app‚Äôs authentication method is now included in the ‚ÄúSecurity Settings‚Äù section. If not set up, you'll be warned. ‚úãü§®
* Boot panel checks are now visible (and expanded/improved based on your feedback!). We‚Äôre still iterating on this, so please let us know [on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MYKpYQ3fbP){:target="\_blank"} if you have any more feedback.
* To make the panel more robust, it now honors emergency access via a `GRIST_BOOT_KEY` setting if authentication is broken, and should even be usable if the app has some common misconfigurations. This means you can count on the admin panel not becoming inaccessible just when you need it most!

## Community highlights

* marc.fargas has provided our community with a [excellently detailed walkthrough](https://community.getgrist.com/t/pdf-rendering-with-apitemplate-io-pipedream/4984){:target="\_blank"} of his Grist ‚Üí PDF rendering pipeline. The solution does require external services (which may not be completely free), but it‚Äôs an great example of extending Grist.
* Riccardo_Polignieri has created a Python wrapper for Grist‚Äôs API called [PyGrister](https://community.getgrist.com/t/pygrister-a-python-client-for-the-grist-api/5015){:target="\_blank"}! Get more Python in your workflow!

### Reference and Choice Dropdown List Filtering

In May, Anais returned to look at how filtering a reference or choice column‚Äôs dropdown list is very useful in a variety of cases. See how to take advantage of one of Grist‚Äôs newest and most sneakily-powerful features.
