## What’s new

### Import from Airtable

![Import from Airtable](../images/newsletters/2026-02/airtable-migration.gif)

We’re very excited to announce the you can now [Import from Airtable](https://support.getgrist.com/imports/#import-from-airtable){:target="\_blank"}! This new feature preserves the full contents of your base (including attachments) and the relationships between them. We’ve even tested it on an attachment-heavy base that turned into a reasonably-performant 5GB Grist doc.

You can start importing right now, and be sure to check out our [webinar recording](https://www.getgrist.com/webinars/migrate-airtable-to-grist-webinar/){:target="\_blank"} that goes through three advanced examples of why going from Airtable to Grist can be, dare we say, joyous. At the very least skip to 14:30 to see Amandine’s real world example of event management.

### Vibe View

![Vibe View widget](../images/newsletters/2026-02/vibe-view.gif)

As previewed in last month’s webinar, co-CEO Dmitry has shared his own custom widget called [Vibe View](https://github.com/gristlabs/vibe-view-widget){:target="\_blank"}. There’s been a wave of widgets created with the help of AI, and this one is focused specifically on creating a read-only view of Grist data using a single [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html){:target="\_blank"} HTML template. The widget even provides the prompt for you to use in your chatbot of choice, with copy/paste being the only other tool required.

Check out the [sample document](https://public.getgrist.com/7UTeRka3jcr3/Invoicing/p/1){:target="\_blank"} to see a printable invoice generator created using Vibe View, and you can use the widget yourself by adding it from the [custom widget gallery](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/#premade-custom-widgets){:target="\_blank"}. 

![grist-core release](../images/newsletters/core-release.png)
Two new releases to talk about:

* v1.7.11 for `grist-core`.
* v0.3.10 for `grist-desktop`.

## Community highlights

* It’s been a while since the last translation update, but a huge thanks for endsho’s contributions to Indonesian, and martin.thure’s Swedish translation! If you’re interested in helping translate Grist, check out [this thread.](https://community.getgrist.com/t/translating-grist/2086){:target="\_blank"}
![Mind map widget](../images/newsletters/2026-02/mindmap.gif)
* C0M-R3D shared a [mind map widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/custom-widget-mind-map-ported-from-obsidian/13655/4){:target="\_blank"} based on lynchjames’ Obsidian plugin. The widget uses Markmap to render Markdown as a tree, but C0M-R3D shared a [detailed example document](https://docs.getgrist.com/eNQthwssqbkc/MindMapWidget/p/4){:target="\_blank"} showing how a simple Python formula can format Grist data to be shown as a map.
![ABC notation widget](../images/newsletters/2026-02/abc-notation.gif)
* Former Grister and forever Grist star Jordi fielded a request on Discord for an [ABC musical notation custom widget](https://grist.jordigh.com/o/docs/d6V1MxE5LiD5/ABC-musical-notation-custom-widget){:target="\_blank"} using [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs){:target="\_blank"}!
* Frequent contributor jperon is back with [“poor man’s self-hosted Grist”](https://community.getgrist.com/t/poor-man-s-self-hosted-grist/13710){:target="\_blank"} – essentially a Docker Compose package for first-time self-hosters. Compared to Grist Omnibus, it uses an OpenResty reverse proxy and contains a user management endpoint.
![Reference sanitization](../images/newsletters/2026-02/sanitize-ref.gif)
* On the French Grist forum, there’s a [neat discussion](https://forum.grist.libre.sh/t/formule-dinitialisation-pour-nettoyer-les-erreurs-de-saisie-sur-une-colonne-de-reference/3005/7){:target="\_blank"} on sanitizing reference column inputs using a trigger formula. This can help avoid errors from problematic characters or malformed spaces, as in the example above.
![OpenStreetMap widget](../images/newsletters/2026-02/openstreetmap.png)
* fcuignet has shared an [OpenStreetMap widget](https://github.com/fcuignet/GristOSM){:target="\_blank"} (on the right in the screenshot above) made with the custom widget builder. It just works!
