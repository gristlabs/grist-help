## Access rules

Grist now offers "access rules" for fine-grained control of who can
see (or edit) which parts of your document at the table, column, and
row level. In December, we invited those interested in early access
to try the feature out. We've made a lot of improvements, and are
now excited to open the feature to the public.

![Access rules page](../images/newsletters/2021-03/access-rules-page.png)

Things to know about access rules:

- Until now, everyone you shared a document with saw the same content.  Now, their
  views can be filtered.  For example, a table or column may be visible only
  to certain users.  Or some users may see only rows that meet a condition.

- Until now, all editors and owners of a document could change anything about its
  content.  Now, document owners can control what specific editors can change.
  For example, a table or column may be locked for certain editors.  Or some
  editors may only update, add, or remove rows that meet a condition.

- If you need it, editors can be organized into groups or teams using
  a table within the document itself, and granted permissions
  systematically.

- You can make special links to give ad-hoc view access to pieces of the document,
  including documents shared with the public.

Access rules are marked as a Beta feature, meaning that the design of
access rules is likely to evolve, and sometimes that will require
updates to documents that use them. We won’t make such changes
lightly.

Grist access rules put great power in your hands. With that power
comes great responsibility. Take your time to [read our documentation](../access-rules.md),
[explore the examples](../access-rules.md#access-rule-examples),
and [test the rules you create](../access-rules.md#view-as-another-user). Feel free to
reach out to consult us as well, at <support@getgrist.com>. We'll be
glad to help.

## New Example

Access rules let you control how a shared document is used, and maintain
a separation of roles and responsibilities.
In our [Lead List](../examples/2021-03-leads.md) example, we suppose an entrepeneur
is using Grist as an ad-hoc lead tracker for sales and potential advisors, and
show how they can use access rules to shape collaboration.

## Quick Tips

 - **Cell Color**.  You can add a splash of color to a column using the `Cell Color` option
for Columns (in tables) or Fields (in cards).  The color will apply consistently
in all views where cells from that column appear.

    ![Cell color](../images/newsletters/2021-03/cell-color.png)

 - **SQL Queries**.  Grist documents are also downloadable SQL databases, in SQLite
format. If you download your document
(via the <span class="grist-icon" style="--icon: var(--icon-Share)"></span> button)
you can query it using the standard [sqlite3 tool](https://sqlite.org/cli.html)
(available on the [SQLite site](https://sqlite.org/download.html)) or from just
about any language or database tool.  Your tables and columns in Grist will show up exactly
as SQLite tables and columns.  Here's a query against the
[Lead List](../examples/2021-03-leads.md) example document:

    ![Leads SQL query](../images/newsletters/2021-03/leads-sql.png)

    You may not need to do this often, but when you do it is very handy.
    We've recently improved the fit between SQLite column types and Grist column types,
    so if a database importer fails to recognize a column, try recreating the column or converting
    it to a more precise type (e.g. Integer, Text, Numeric, Date, DateTime etc).

  of a few very short introductory videos:
  [Grist Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3Q9Tu1JOy_4Mq8JlcjZXEMyJY69kda44).

- Each of our featured [Examples & Templates](https://docs.getgrist.com/p/templates)
  has a related tutorial that shows step-by-step how to build it
  from scratch. Read through one to gain a deeper understanding of how
  various features play together.
