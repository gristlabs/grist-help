## What’s new

### Comments 💬

![Comments](../images/newsletters/2025-08/commentsv2-full.gif)

When collaborating on a spreadsheet, sometimes you want to flag specific data or start a discussion with other members of your team. Sometimes you see a cell in a spreadsheet and just want to let it know how valuable it is by attaching a nice personal message. Now you can do both!

You can add comments to cells, reply to threads, and even @-mention specific users. There’s also a new panel on the right side of the screen showing all comments (with filters!). See the full documentation [here](https://support.getgrist.com/sharing/#comments){:target="\_blank"}.

But there’s more – comments are made extra useful with this next new feature...

### Email notifications 📧

![Email notifications](../images/newsletters/2025-08/notifications-transparent.png)

Previously, the only document-related emails you would receive from Grist were sharing invites. Now, you can enable per-document notifications for document changes and comments from other users!

If you’re using the Grist SaaS at getgrist.com, you will automatically start getting notifications for @-mentions and replies to your comments. You can change your email notification preferences in [Document Settings](https://support.getgrist.com/document-settings/#notifications){:target="\_blank"}. If you’re self-hosting, email notifications are limited to Grist Enterprise. But for self-hosters, there’s even more – read the next announcement...

### Free Grist Enterprise for qualifying self-hosters

To enable email notifications, self-hosted instances will need to be on Grist Enterprise – which is **free for qualifying self-hosters.** How do you know if you qualify? Basically, if your organization has total finances of <$1M per year. For complete details, see this [FAQ answer](https://www.getgrist.com/pricing/#faq-free-self-hosted-enterprise){:target="\_blank"}.

To set up email notifications on an Enterprise self-hosted instance, see [this article](https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/#how-do-i-set-up-email-notifications){:target="\_blank"}.

### GristCon - new sessions added!

[![GristCon banner](../images/newsletters/2025-08/gristcon-banner.png)](https://www.getgrist.com/gristcon-2025/#agenda){:target="\_blank"}

In addition to the [excellent sessions announced last month](https://www.getgrist.com/gristcon-2025/#agenda){:target="\_blank"}, we’ve added two more sessions to the stacked GristCon 2025 slate:

1. *Unlock the power of SQL to query Grist documents and visualize them seamlessly in Apache Superset - Quentin Leroy*

    When we think of SQL we don’t always think of visualizations. We can also forget that Grist is an actual database. Join Quentin in exploring how to use open-source data explorer [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/){:target="\_blank"} to explore data from Grist with his custom-built API adapter. Come explore!
    
2. *Off the grid: how anyone can build custom visualizations with custom widgets - Evan Buxton*

    One of the strengths of Grist's relational structure is that your data *has* structure. This means that if you dare to dream beyond the spreadsheet, you're starting from a solid foundation. Join Evan as he creates dynamic dashboards for interactive projects with the help of AI and GitHub pages – some for himself, some for the wider team, and some to be handed off for further refinement, development and design. 

### Row height controls!

![Row height control](../images/newsletters/2025-08/row-height.gif)

This feature is so new that it’s currently *undocumented*. Now you can set the maximum height for a row, or ensure that all rows are the same height regardless of column contents.  

### Grist secret: Popups

![Secret popups](../images/newsletters/2025-08/popup.png)

Customer engineer Natalie, by way of Grist developer Jarek, wrote a post detailing a handy trick covered in our recent [Grist Secrets webinar](https://www.getgrist.com/webinars/grist-secrets/){:target="\_blank"} - widget popups. With this – admittedly circuitous – trick you can open up a widget/view in an editable lightbox, like an image. Everyone likes popups!

### More updates

* Thanks to a [PR from mrdev023](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/pull/1655){:target="\_blank"}, you can now add attachment fields to forms!
* If you’re a self-hoster who has [customized styling](https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/#how-do-i-customize-styling){:target="\_blank"}, it now applies also to forms.

![grist-core release](../images/newsletters/core-release.png)

There is a new `grist-core` release: 1.7.3. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases/tag/v1.7.3){:target="\_blank"} for some extra tidbits as to what’s included.

##  Community highlights

![Ultra kanban](../images/newsletters/2025-08/ultra-kanban.png)

Grist community regular and [recent case study feature](https://www.getgrist.com/case-studies/how-grist-became-a-construction-companys-swiss-army-saas/){:target="\_blank"} Rogerio released his [Ultra Kanban Widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/release-of-ultra-kanban-widget/10925){:target="\_blank"}, which is loaded with features, including lane-specific card layouts, automation rules, and multiple translations... including latin!
