## What’s new

### 2025 is over!

![2025 year in review](../images/newsletters/2025-12/2025-year-in-review.png)

Check out our [end-of-year write-up](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-2025-year-in-review/){:target="\_blank"} covering 2025’s highlights: new features, makeovers, a virtual conference, and our deepest secrets.

### Help Center redesign

![Help Center redesign](../images/newsletters/2025-12/help-center-redesign.png)

We’ve done a significant redesign of the [Grist Help Center](https://support.getgrist.com/){:target="\_blank"}, home to our support and developer documentation. This has been another productive collaboration with [Emmanuel Pelletier](https://github.com/manuhabitela){:target="\_blank"}!

### GrainJS

We’ve also done some work on the [documentation for GrainJS](https://gristlabs.github.io/grainjs/){:target="\_blank"}, a light web framework upon which Grist is built. [GrainJS](https://github.com/gristlabs/grainjs){:target="\_blank"} has always been there, but now you can better understand the frontend powering your spreadsheets – only 30kb and dependency-free!

### Miscellaneous

* We’ve made the operations an Editor (as opposed to an Owner – learn more about roles [here](https://support.getgrist.com/team-sharing/#roles){:target="\_blank"}) can perform on a resource more consistent across team sites, workspaces, and documents. Specifically:
  * An Editor can no longer rename or delete an organization, only an Owner can.
  * An Editor can no longer rename, delete, or undelete a workspace, only an Owner can.
* We’ve implemented several [improvements to RecordSet handling](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/pull/1992){:target="\_blank"}. 
* There’s also a new [Grist Desktop release](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-desktop/releases/tag/v0.3.7){:target="\_blank"} with core updates and a few fixes.

## Community highlights

* Thanks to everyone who participated in the Grist-sponsored [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/){:target="\_blank"} this year, especially those who shared their solutions on Discord and commiserated with those who received many many many RecursionErrors.
* User dtnth on Discord shared a utility that transforms your Grist document’s code view to a TypeScript-ready API interface. Check it out [here](https://dt.in.th/GristTypeGenerator){:target="\_blank"}, in all its Comic Mono glory.
  * If you use n8n with Grist, you may also be interested in dtnth’s [pending PR](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/18067){:target="\_blank"} for adding support for the upsert operation. If you don’t use n8n or make database queries regularly, you probably learned a new term (upsert), which is a melding of “update” and “insert”. Kind of like “grid” and “list”!
* Antonin Peronnet has shared a few [handy widgets](https://github.com/rambip/grist-attachment-widgets){:target="\_blank"} that deal with attachments:
  * A simple image/PDF viewer
  * A way to generate attachment URLs for in-document display (like in the Markdown or HTML widget)
  * A formula that allows self-hosters to generate attachment URLs for external websites
![Attachment widgets](../images/newsletters/2025-12/attachment-widgets.gif)
* Riccardo_Polignieri has updated [Pygrister](https://community.getgrist.com/t/pygrister-a-python-client-for-the-grist-api/5015/17){:target="\_blank"} – a Grist Python client – which quickly approaches a 1.0 release.
* Over on *le forum*, Aude shared a [simple widget](https://forum.grist.libre.sh/t/custom-widget-clean-text-afficher-du-texte-avec-de-jolies-police-dont-marianne/2365){:target="\_blank"} to display configurable text in a widget pane whose data is stored in the widget configuration itself rather than table data. Voila:
![Clean text widget](../images/newsletters/2025-12/clean-text.png)
* If you’re cartographically-inclined and have a MapBox account, you can try out nic01asFr’s [custom widget](https://forum.grist.libre.sh/t/widget-grist-mapbox/2426){:target="\_blank"} that lets you import and visualize geographic data, configure styles from Grist data, and export to GeoJSON.
![MapBox widget](../images/newsletters/2025-12/mapbox.png)
* nic01asFr also shared a [trifecta of useful project management custom widgets](https://forum.grist.libre.sh/t/kaban-gantt-calendar-suite-de-widgets-pour-la-gestion-de-taches/2337){:target="\_blank"}: kanban, Gantt, and the classic calendar.
* Raphael_Guenot has shared [two custom widgets](https://community.getgrist.com/t/liquid-templates/13136){:target="\_blank"} that enable easy client-side templating using [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/){:target="\_blank"}. Importantly, the custom viewer has a dedicated “Print” button for easy PDF export.

## Learning Grist

### Grist 101

New to Grist? Check out our webinar designed to get you up to speed on essential features and helpful tricks.

### Webinar: Advanced formulas with ordered lookups

[![Advanced formulas with ordered lookups webinar](../images/newsletters/2025-12/webinar-social.png)](https://www.getgrist.com/webinars/advanced-formulas-with-ordered-lookups/?utm_source=support-newsletter&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=build-webinar&utm_term=january-2025){:target="\_blank"}

Sometimes you want to mosey down a table, row by row, and and get a running total. Or you need a formula in the current record to use the previous one, or to find the last record before a certain date, or the first event of the next month. With Grist’s ordered lookups and functions such as `PREVIOUS()`, you can do cumulative calculations, nearest matches, and more. Join their implementor and co-CEO Dmitry for a deep dive on Grist functionality that goes under the radar, but serves as a perfect and efficient tool for a range of data workflows.

**Thursday January 15th at 11:00am US Eastern Time.**

[SIGN-UP FOR JANUARY'S WEBINAR](https://www.getgrist.com/webinars/advanced-formulas-with-ordered-lookups/?utm_source=support-newsletter&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=build-webinar&utm_term=january-2025){:target="\_blank"}
