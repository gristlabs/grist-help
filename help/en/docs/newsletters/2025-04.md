## What's new

### Grist AI Assistant

![AI Assistant](../images/newsletters/2025-04/assistant.gif)

Last year we launched an AI-powered formula assistant, focused on chatlike Python and Excel formula support. The next version of this approach is the Grist Assistant, going beyond formulas. Despite the similar name, this Assistant greatly expands what you‚Äôre able to do with AI in Grist, with a focus on being maximally useful while maintaining data integrity:

* Answer questions about your formulas and your data
* Create or modify records and formulas, with 'undo' support

This new power comes with a couple caveats: 1) when you submit a query, your data is shared with OpenAI and 2) the Assistant can‚Äôt make structural changes (table/column/widget modification, access rule changes). We‚Äôre excited to see how you use these new capabilities and have our eyes open for future improvements. 

The new Grist Assistant is available on getgrist.com and for self-hosters on the Enterprise plan, with the legacy Formula Assistant remaining for all other users. For more information, check out our [Help Center documentation](https://support.getgrist.com/assistant/){:target="\_blank"}.

### Other

* Spreadsheet Makeover episode 6 is out! This one tackles one of the big differences between Grist and normal spreadsheets, the combination of the view and data layers. [Watch on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_kLswSXOss){:target="\_blank"}
* Hurricane season is approaching, and our Support Engineer Natalie has created a [hurricane readiness template](https://templates.getgrist.com/uXMbETLdfriM/Hurricane-Preparedness){:target="\_blank"} to help you stay prepared.

![grist-core release](../images/newsletters/core-release.png)

There has been a new `grist-core` release (v1.5.2). Hop on over to GitHub for the [full release notes](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases){:target="\_blank"}.

## Community highlights

* Huge thanks to Manu for his major [theme refactoring](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/pull/1340){:target="\_blank"}, which puts themes for Grist on a more solid basis. There‚Äôs also a [migration guide](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/blob/main/static/custom.css){:target="\_blank"} for users who built themes with the previous structure.
* Simon Mulquin has been sharing lots of neat Grist experiments, including one that shows live, in-context translations from table data. It even supports in-context data linking, where you click on a rendered HTML string in the widget and it selects that record in the table. Check out his [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_0RMhJWLRQ){:target="\_blank"} for an overview.
* Varamil‚Äôs modestly named [simple filter widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/simple-filter-widget/9356){:target="\_blank"} is indeed simple, but also incredibly useful and [well-documented](https://github.com/Varamil/grist-widget/tree/main/simplefilter#grist-simple-filer-widget){:target="\_blank"}! It takes a second of testing to see its power:.
![Simple filter widget](../images/newsletters/2025-04/simple-filter.gif)

* Varamil has also blessed us with a [widget that synchronizes widgets and views](https://community.getgrist.com/t/update-of-drop-down-widget-for-multi-page-synchronization/9384){:target="\_blank"} *across pages*. That‚Äôs right, you select a value in the dropdown and it remains selected on other pages, even updating any widget linking already in place. 
![Dropdown sync widget](../images/newsletters/2025-04/linked-dropdown.gif)

* Following up on Sylvain_Page‚Äôs [Excalidraw widget](https://support.getgrist.com/newsletters/2025-02/#community-highlights){:target="\_blank"} from earlier this year, LGDan has released his very own [draw.io viewer and editor](https://community.getgrist.com/t/draw-io-viewer-and-editor-custom-widget/9362){:target="\_blank"}, which is also [excellently documented](https://github.com/LGDan/grist-widget-drawio?tab=readme-ov-file#grist-widget-drawio){:target="\_blank"}. As a bonus, the widget can extract XML data from the generated PNGs, which lets you do lots of cool things such as row/entity lookups and even constraint validation √† la systems engineering. ü§Ø

* For a change of pace, take a look at Dynnammo‚Äôs [ManyWords proof-of-concept widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/building-a-750words-open-source-alternative-with-grist/9407){:target="\_blank"}, which is inspired by 750words and aims to get you writing every day.
