## What's New

### We rickrolled, and so can you

Last month we invited you to answer a Grist survey and rewarded your kindness with an April Fool‚Äôs joke: a [rickroll](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rickroll){:target="\_blank"} in Grist. 

The great news is that you can pay this forward whenever you like to whomever you like with any document. Take any Grist anchor link and replace the r in the URL with rr. We call it ‚Äúrickrow‚Äù because that r anchors to a row. 

To find an anchor link, right click on any cell and select ‚Äúcopy anchor link‚Äù from the context menu (keyboard shortcut shown in menu).

![Copy Anchor Link](../images/newsletters/2023-04/copy-anchor-link.png)

In this case the anchor link is `https://templates.getgrist.com/doc/lightweight-crm#a1.s1.r20.c2`

To rickrow someone, edit the anchor link to `https://templates.getgrist.com/doc/lightweight-crm#a1.s1.rr20.c2` 

For full rickrolling, be sure the recipient can access the document!

### Grist-static: Publish data on static sites without embeds

Take a peek at our CTO Paul‚Äôs latest experiment. Grist-static offers a way to view and interact with .grist files on regular websites, with no special back-end support needed. Grist-static is great for displaying spreadsheet reports on a website, similar to PDF reports, but better! 

With grist-static, viewers will be able to change selections, and experiment with changing numbers to see what happens. Every viewer has their own copy, and their changes won't be seen by others, or stored. This would also be a scalable way to show a Grist document to millions of simultaneous users.

See some examples [here](https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-static){:target="\_blank"}.

Learn more on [Github](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-static){:target="\_blank"}.

**We want to hear from you.**

Do you already see a use case for grist-static? Are you excited by it? Tell us by emailing us at <support@getgrist.com>, or posting in our [community forum](https://community.getgrist.com/){:target="\_blank"}. This is just the beginning for grist-static and your input helps guide our design.

### Another werewolf strike:  MOONPHASE()

Another function contribution by user [@were_functions](https://twitter.com/were_functions){:target="\_blank"} on Twitter. The MOONPHASE() function returns the phase of the moon on the given date. Here's what it tells us about the date of this newsletter: `MOONPHASE(TODAY())` is üåì. With other arguments, we can find that it's been 8 days since new moon, or 0.27 of a month. Also that `MOONPHASE(TODAY(), "lunacy")` is üï∫. Safe for now, but it's less than a week to the next full moon. Someone ought to start taking the wolfsbane potion.

Try it yourself! Tip: Replace "lunacy" with "days" to calculate the age of the moon in days, or "fraction" to calculate the fraction of the lunar month since the new moon.

### Webinar: Importing Data

Many Grist users have imported spreadsheets into Grist, but not all are aware of all the cool import features that Grist offers, such as incremental imports, merge fields, and formula transformations. In May, we‚Äôll dig into importing data like a pro.

**Tuesday May 16th at 12:00pm US Eastern Time.**
