## What's New

### New  Date Filter with Calendar

Filtering date and datetime columns just got easier. You can now select a date range using a calendar picker. 

The bounds of the range may also be relative — for example, from `1st day of this month` to `Today`. The filter will update with each passing day.

![Date Filter](../images/newsletters/2022-12/date-filter.png)

### Snapshots in Grist Core

Previously, snapshots were available on hosted Grist and the self-managed enterprise plan, and relied on commercial cloud storage services. Now, snapshot support is also available on [Grist Core](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core){:target="\_blank"} — the open source version of Grist — and can work with open source self-hosted storage options such as MinIO. 🎉 Learn how to [set up snapshots](../self-managed.md#how-do-i-set-up-snapshots){:target="\_blank"}.

### Quick Delete for Invalid Table/Column Access Rules

If there are access rules for a table or column that has been deleted, there is now a convenient button to delete the rules that apply to the deleted column or table. 

You remain in control of which rules remain and which are deleted, so you don't have to worry about rules disappearing if you are reorganizing your document.

![Invalid Rule Deletion Button](../images/newsletters/2022-12/invalid-rule-button.png)
In this example, the `Breeder_Retirement` column has been deleted, so the column rule for that column should also be deleted.

### Improved UI for Memo Writing

Access rules now have a memo button to add memos to rules, making writing and editing memos more convenient.

![Access Rules Memo Button](../images/newsletters/2022-12/ui-memo-writing.png)
Memos can really help colleagues understand why they can't do something, since memos are shown in a popup when an action is blocked by a rule.
