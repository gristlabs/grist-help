## What's new

### Cumulative functions: `PREVIOUS()`, `NEXT()` and `RANK()`

![Cumulative functions](../images/newsletters/2024-07/cumulative-full.gif)

If you’ve ever tried to get a running total in a Grist table, or access previous values for calculations, we have some good news. We’ve added a series of new functionality related to cumulative functions that greatly expand what you can do in the grid:

* `PREVIOUS()` finds the previous record in a full table. `NEXT()` is the same, but in the other direction. 
* `RANK()` returns the rank of the record within the group, starting with 1.

Check out our complete documentation in our [Help Center](https://support.getgrist.com/functions/#cumulative){:target="\_blank"}.

### New kinds of lookups: `find.*` methods 

Even for a Python pro, it can be tricky to look up items based on nearness to a threshold, especially if the lookup needs to be efficient. These new `find.*` methods make it far easier. Essentially, `lookupRecords()` now allows search in sorted results! Here’s an example, showing the old way (🐢🙅) and the new way (🏃‍➡️): 

![Pay rate example](../images/newsletters/2024-07/find-methods.png)

More details:

* The `find.*` methods are `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt`, and `eq` (less than or equal, less than, greater than or equal, greater than, equal).
* The `order_by` argument now supports tuples, as well as the "-" prefix to reverse order, e.g. `("Category", "-Date")`.

See the full documentation in our [Help Center](https://support.getgrist.com/functions/#find_){:target="\_blank"}.

### Tutorial progress

If you’re reading this, you probably don’t need to complete our basics tutorial. Still, we wanted to show off this cool new progress bar and hint at further onboarding improvements to help get new users up to speed! You are also now approximately 38% through this newsletter. Good job! 📈

### Grist Enterprise: now a toggle!

![Enterprise toggle](../images/newsletters/2024-07/enterprise-toggle.gif)

For our large enterprise users, installing Grist just got easier: you can now use the standard Docker image! We’ve consolidated images so that enabling and activating Enterprise is done in the admin console. This also means non-Enterprise users can trial Enterprise features like [GristConnect](https://support.getgrist.com/install/grist-connect/){:target="\_blank"} and [Azure/S3 storage](https://support.getgrist.com/install/cloud-storage/#azure){:target="\_blank"} for 30 days. The full Enterprise plan also includes installation support and professional services provided by our Grist experts. Check out our [Pricing page](https://www.getgrist.com/pricing/){:target="\_blank"} for details.

### Grist ActivePieces integration

![ActivePieces integration](../images/newsletters/2024-07/activepieces.png)

Open source automation tool [ActivePieces](https://www.activepieces.com/){:target="\_blank"} now has [a bunch of Grist-specific actions & triggers](https://www.activepieces.com/pieces/grist){:target="\_blank"}. Thanks to Kishan Parmar for the [pull request](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/pull/5069){:target="\_blank"}!

### Improved column rename syncing

A [small but mighty fix](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/pull/1038){:target="\_blank"} that addresses several usability frustrations across Grist. Now, when you rename a column, associated [access control](https://support.getgrist.com/access-rules/#access-rules){:target="\_blank"} and [conditional formatting](https://support.getgrist.com/conditional-formatting/){:target="\_blank"} rules update automatically! 

![Column renaming](../images/newsletters/2024-07/column-rename.gif)

### Fly.io build previews for external contributors

If you’re a [`grist-core`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core){:target="\_blank"} contributor working on a PR, we now have automatic previews for your work. Everyone can now see live demos, which should help move the review process along! We use [Fly.io](http://fly.io/){:target="\_blank"} to run a self-hosted instance of Grist including your code.

## User spotlight – Callum Spawforth/Savage Game Design

![Grist game design database](../images/newsletters/2024-07/callum-3.png)

When he isn’t working on Grist, Callum ([@Spoffy](https://github.com/Spoffy){:target="\_blank"} on GitHub) works with the team at Savage Game Design to develop Vietnam War-era video games. The Savage team and their military advisors strive to make their game historically accurate, which means keeping track of a ton of real-world events, places, people, units, etc... and then relating them all back to each other.

The team uses Grist to build an event database as they create their storylines, treating it as a “starting point to map out what \[they\] want to happen during a certain time period.” As storylines evolve and become more complex, they connect their Grist documents with other tools like Google Docs, maintaining a link with their single source of truth. Instead of just having a Game Design Document, they now also have a Game Design Database.

## Community highlights

* A new [Basque translation](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/grist/client/eu/){:target="\_blank"} is nearly complete, thanks to xabirequejo! See [here](https://community.getgrist.com/t/translating-grist/2086){:target="\_blank"} for more information on helping translate Grist.
* If you’ve used our [Proposals & Contracts template](https://public.getgrist.com/nyPmvvea8c54/Proposals-and-Contracts-Template/m/fork){:target="\_blank"} (or even followed [our tutorial](https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2023-07-proposals-contracts/#creating-proposals){:target="\_blank"} on how to build it!), you’ll be interested to see this updated Markdown widget templating function from [Discord](https://discord.gg/MYKpYQ3fbP){:target="\_blank"} user celine de france. This function is an easier way to replace fields within a template (even nested within references!), effectively automating the process for most cases. See their original post [here](https://discord.com/channels/1176642613022044301/1176646309223075860/1255885603153907844){:target="\_blank"}, or check out a [live demo](https://public.getgrist.com/rshLAdMBmoWJ/Markdown-reports-Celine-formula/p/16#a1.s52.r1.c36){:target="\_blank"}.
