# Admin Panel

Your Grist installation can be managed from the Admin Panel. It is available for all self-hosted instances of Grist as well as all Enterprise plans, whether managed by Grist Labs or hosted on your own servers. The Admin Panel is only available to the Grist [installation administrator](self-managed.md#what-is-the-administrative-account).

When signed in as the administrator of your site, open the Admin Panel from either the 'Grist Resources' menu at the bottom-left of the screen, or from the user dropdown menu.
