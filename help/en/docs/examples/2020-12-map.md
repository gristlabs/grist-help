# Adding a Map

It can be useful sometimes to visualize lists of locations on a geographic map.
Grist can do that if a table has at least a `Name`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude` column.
Suppose we have a list of some of the largest objects in America:

![List of large objects](/examples/images/2020-12-map/large-objects.png)

The first step to making a map for these is to add a [Custom Widget](../widget-custom.md) to the page:

![Add custom widget](/examples/images/2020-12-map/add-custom.png)

Once we set the widget to be `https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/map/`
and give it `Read table` access, a map should appear:

![Add map widget](/examples/images/2020-12-map/set-map.png)

Clicking around in the list of objects brings up the corresponding
"pop-up" on the map.
We can add other sections to taste, such as a detail "card" view
of the attraction's details. This example is available at
<https://public.getgrist.com/3boQPJrgFmFi/Large-in-America/m/fork>{:target="\_blank"}.

This example has some hidden columns related to geocoding (the process
of automatically calculating coordinates from addresses).  You can see
these on the second page called `Geocoding`.  They are `Geocode`,
`Address`, and `GeocodedAddress`.  If you would like to use geocoding,
you'll need these three columns, and to grant the map widget full
access to your document so it can store results.  `Address` should
hold exactly what you want to pass to the geocoder.  In the example,
it is simply `", ".join([$City, $State])`.  The `GeocodedAddress` should
be left untouched; it is a space for the geocoder to store information.
Finally, `Geocode` is a toggle that should be turned on to automatically
generate latitude and longitudes.

![Geocoding](/examples/images/2020-12-map/geocoding.png)


The geocoder will not touch any rows
with `Geocode` turned off.  When `Geocode` is turned on for a row,
latitudes and longitudes are computed and stored automatically for that row
using [Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim).
Nominatim's [Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/)
allows for limited, non-bulk creative use.
Robust geocoding generally requires an account with an external service and a secret API key.
We expect to soon have a convenient way to store secrets in a document,
and will then be able to support flexible geocoding options.  If you are
interested in previewing this feature, please get in touch!

Finally, if you know some HTML/CSS/JS, or have a web developer on your
team, you'll find the map custom widget simple to restyle as you like.
If you need a hand, just let us know.
