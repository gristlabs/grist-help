# Record Cards

Record Cards are a quick, easy way to view a record's details. 

To view a record's details as a card, hover over the row number and click the arrow icon that appears. Select 'View as card' from the dropdown menu.

This opens an editable card view of the record's details.

If your table contains a [reference or reference list column](col-refs.md), you can click the link icon to open the linked record's card.

A record card will open to display record data for the referenced record.
