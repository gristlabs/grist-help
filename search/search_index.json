Select the site (organization) to which you want to transfer the document. This will create a copy, so you\u2019ll still have the original document in your original site. You can always delete it. Learn more about copying documents . How many rows can I have? # As a rule of thumb, Grist works best for documents under 100,000 rows. The actual limit depends also on the number of tables, columns, and the average size of data in each cell. One way to estimate it is to measure the size of the data when it is in CSV format: the limit is around 20MB in this format. For example, a document with 200,000 rows and 12 numeric columns would reach that. Attachments are counted separately. Attachments plus data in a single document are limited to 1GB. Learn more about limits . Does Grist accept non-English characters? # Non-English characters are supported in column labels, but not column ids, which are the column\u2019s Python name used in formulas. When importing a file into Grist, non-English characters do import as values in cells, but do not import into column labels (aka headers). The column labels are approximated with English characters. You may rename the column labels to include non-English characters after import. To edit column labels and ids separately, open the creator panel and select the column menu. Click the link icon that joins label to id to enable column id editing. While non-English characters are not supported, it is possible to edit the ids into something more clear and friendly to use in formulas. How do I sum the total of a column? # To summarize multiple records, you need summary tables . The major difference between Grist and spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets is that Grist is a database, so each row in a grid represents a record (e.g. a person, a bank transaction, etc.) Since a sum across multiple records isn\u2019t the same kind of record, Grist offers summarizing data as a separate widget, which can be modified to calculate even more powerful summary data. For example, suppose you have a table of webstore orders called Orders and you want to sum sales revenue from all orders. At the top of the left-side menu, click \u201cAdd New\u201d button and select \u201cAdd Page\u201d or \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In the widget picker, select the Orders table then click the summation icon ( ) next to it. Add the page or widget to your document. Done! You\u2019ve now created a summary table that by default counts all the records in the Orders table, and sums all numeric and integer columns, such as the amount sold in each order. Summary tables can do more than a sum of a tables\u2019 columns. With just a few clicks you can summarize orders by month to calculate the number of orders and total sales revenue in each month for which you have data. Take it a step further and suppose you have multiple webstores. With Grist, you can record all sales orders across all stores and months in the same table. Then, you can summarize by month and webstore. When you add more months (or stores!) to the orders table, the summary table will automatically update, which is another key difference with spreadsheets. In Excel, you would need to expand your formula\u2019s range, or add more sheets and modify formulas everytime you added more sales orders, months, or stores. In Grist, you create the summary table once, and let Grist do the future work for you. In addition to our summary tables article, we have a video tutorial and follow-along guide that provides an example in building a dashboard with summary tables. Sharing # What does Team (+2 Per Doc) mean? # Team members all have access to a team site , which is located at a url with a custom subdomain, such as your-company.getgrist.com . The team plan costs $8/month/team member. Team site owners may open the Billing Account page to manage payment and edit plan managers. By default, documents within a team site may be accessed by all team members. This default can be modified to only share certain documents or certain workspaces with specific team members. At the document level, you may choose to share a document with up to 2 outside collaborators (non-team members) at no additional cost. For example, say Wiley Co. has a team site with 5 team members. They pay $40 per month to collaborate in Grist on an unlimited number of documents. Wiley Co. sometimes works with a contractor on a project, a company called Roadrunner. Wiley Co. shares one of their documents with 2 Roadrunner employees at no additional cost. Those two document-level shares are considered outside collaborators, or guests. Wiley Co. sometimes works with a second contractor, a company called ACME. Wiley Co. shares one of their documents with 2 ACME employees at no additional cost. Wiley Co. has four outside collaborators, or guests, but since there are at most 2 per document, there is no additional cost. Can I only share Grist documents with my team? # There are many ways to share Grist data with non-team members. Outside collaborators. Each document may be shared with 2 outside collaborators (non-team members) at no additional cost. Link Sharing. In share settings, there is an option to turn on public access . The public access role can be set to viewer or editor. Anyone with a link can view (or edit) your data. Those views would not count towards your plan\u2019s user count. The document is visible to anyone with the link, however, so use caution when working with sensitive data. Restricted View-only link sharing. With view-only link sharing, there is a way to further restrict what people can see by using Grist\u2019s access rules to set specific URL parameters called link keys that determine which tables, columns, or rows are shown when a specific link is shared. View-only Embed. Grist pages can be embedded into websites in an iframe. Learn how. Grist and your website/app # Can I embed Grist into my website? # Yes, it is possible to embed Grist pages as view-only data in a website in an iframe. <iframe src=\"https://templates.getgrist.com/6D8E2h2DQNwS/Task-Management/p/6?embed=true></iframe> Replace the url written in the code above with the URL of the Grist page you wish to embed, follow by ?embed=true at the end of the url. Learn more about embedding Grist . Can I use Grist as the backend of my web app? # Using Grist as a backend solution directly to a website or web app is not yet supported. We don\u2019t yet have an authentication method for this use case. The API key method isn\u2019t generally appropriate for web use, because the key would end up accessible to any viewer of the webpage, which is usually undesirable.

We won\u2019t make such changes lightly. Every Grist document can be shared with others using the Manage Users option in the sharing menu ( ). Users can be invited as Viewers, Editors, or Owners (see Sharing a document for a refresher on those roles). Sometimes, you need more nuance about who can see or edit individual parts of a document. Access rules give us that power. Only the owners of a document can edit its access rules. When a document is loaded, owners see a tool called Access Rules in the left side bar. Click on that to view and edit access rules. The rules are also accessible via the Manage Users option of the sharing menu with the Open Access Rules button (available only to document Owners). Suppose we run a small business sourcing and delivering unusual objects, organized using a document with two tables, Orders and Financials . Now we are taking on more employees, and want to share the document with them while limiting their access to just what they need. Default rules # To see the access rules for a document, visit its access rules page by clicking Access Rules in the left sidebar. When no custom rules have been created yet, the access rules page contains the Default Rules for our document: These rules say, in summary, that Owners and Editors can do anything within the document, that Viewers can only read the document, and everyone else is forbidden all access. These rules cannot be modified, but they can be overridden. To understand whether a group of rules allows a certain permission ( Read, Update, Create, Delete, or Structure ), read the rules from top to bottom, and find the first applicable rule that allows (green) or denies (red) that permission. We\u2019ll see plenty of examples as we go. Lock down structure # By default Owners and Editors are equally powerful within a document, with the ability to create or delete tables or columns, write formulas, reorganize pages, and so on. Suppose we want only the original Owners of the document to be allowed to change its structure, as we plan to invite other specialized collaborators as Editors. To do this, we add a default rule specifying that any user who is not an owner ( user.Access != OWNER ) should be denied structure permissions ( S ). Click the little + sign in the CONDITION of the Default Rules and fill in the condition and permissions as follows: For more information about possible formulas, read Access rule conditions . Once we\u2019ve made changes, the SAVE button becomes an inviting green (if is grayed out, and you\u2019ve just composed a condition formula, press enter or click elsewhere to let Grist know you are finished). We click SAVE for the rule to take effect. If Grist finds errors, you\u2019ll be alerted and the changes will not save. Important. This is an important first step for any document where you intend to block any access to Editors. Without denying them the structure permission ( S ), anyone with edit access will be able to create or change formulas. Since formula calculations are not limited by access control rules, a determined user could use them to retrieve any data from a document. To protect against that, deny structure permission to users whose access should be limited. Make a private table # To ensure that only Owners can access a table, such as the Financials table in our example, we click Add Table Rules and select the table name, Financials . This creates a new empty group of rules called Rules for table Financials . Then we add a condition for any user who is not an Owner ( user.Access != OWNER ), with all permissions denied. Selecting Deny All from the drop-down beside R U C D is a fast way to set all permissions to denied, or you can click each permission individually to turn them red. R is Read, U is Update, C is Create, and D is Delete (see Access rule permissions ). Structure ( S ) permissions are not available at the table level. Once you are done, click SAVE . Now we could go ahead and share the document with a team member specialized in deliveries, for example. We share the document with them as an Editor so that the restrictions we\u2019ve set up apply to them. They won\u2019t see the Financials table in the left side bar, and attempts to open it will be denied: Restrict access to columns # We can restrict a collaborator\u2019s access to columns. In our eample, we might wish to give a delivery specialist more limited access to the Orders table. Perhaps they don\u2019t need to see an Email column, or a Piece column with details of what is in the parcel. Click Add Table Rules and select Orders to create a rule group for the Orders table. Now, in the Rules for table Orders group, click the three-dot icon (\u2026), and select Add Column Rule : In the Columns area we have a new [Add Column] dropdown to add all the columns to which we want the rule to apply (in our case Email and Piece ). For the condition, we culd use user.Email == 'kiwi@getgrist.com' . This checks for the email address of Kimberly, our fictional delivery specialist; we could also check by name or a numeric ID. We turn all available permissions off for this user on these columns: Now that the rules are ready, click Save . If we have another employee who specializes in sourcing objects, and who needs to see a different set of columns, we can do that. For example here we add a rule to withhold Address and Phone columns from user Charon : View as another user # A convenient way to check if access rules work as expected is with the View As feature, available in the Users dropdown. This allows an Owner to open the document as if they were one of the people it is shared with, to see what their colleague would see. The Owner does not \u201cbecome\u201d that colleague - any changes they make will be recorded as coming from themselves and not the colleague - but they do see the document from the colleague\u2019s perspective. In our example, we could click View As on the Kiwi row, and the document reopens, with a little red tag warning that we are viewing it as kiwi@getgrist.com . The Piece and Email columns are missing, and the Financials table is surpressed: When satisfied that everything looks as expected, we click the x in the red tag to close this preview, and the document will reload. User attribute tables # If we are successful and hire many sourcing and delivery people, then adding them one by one to rules would be tedious. One solution is to use \u201cuser attribute tables.\u201d You can add a table to your document that classifies users as you like, and then use those classes in your access rules. For example, we can make a table called Team , and give it two columns, Email and Role , where Role is a choice between Sourcing and Delivery . Now we can tell Grist to make information from this table available for access rules, by clicking on Add User Attributes . Give the attribute any name you like (this will be how we refer to it in formulas), such as Team . Pick the table to read ( Team also in this case). Give a user property to match against rows in this table - in our case we\u2019ll use user.Email . And the column to match against, Email . Save that. Now we can update our rules to be more general. We find with autocomplete that we have a new user.Team variable available in condtions. It makes columns from the Team available, such as user.Team.Role . Now we can check if the user has a particular role, and apply the permissions that go with that: Great! Doing a spot check, Charon sees the expected columns for someone in Sourcing. And if we recruit someone else to work with them, we can just add them in the Team table, no rule changes needed. Row-level access control # In our example, as orders are processed, they move from sourcing to delivery phases. So there\u2019s really no need for the two groups to see all the orders at once. Let\u2019s add a column called Stage that can be set to Sourcing or Delivery , so that we can update access rules to show only the relevant orders. In the Rules for table Orders group, click the three-dot icon (\u2026), and select Add Default Rule to add a rule that isn\u2019t limited to specific columns. Let\u2019s deny access to all rows for non-Owners as a starting point, then add back in the ones we want. We can do that with the condition user.Access != \"owners\" with Deny All permissions. Then, we add another default rule by clicking + , and add the condition user.Team.Role == rec.Stage . The rec variable allows us to express rules that depend on the content within a particular record. Here, we check if the Stage column of a record matches the user\u2019s role. If it is, we allow R Read access: Here\u2019s how the table looks now as Kimberly (doing deliveries): And here\u2019s how the table looks as Charon (doing sourcing): Kimberly and Charon now have read-only access to the table. Owners still have full write access to all rows and columns. Understanding reference columns in access rules You can limit the data team members access to just those rows pertinent to their work. One way to do so is to relate all records in all tables to their respective team members. For example, leads and sales records can reference the sales rep responsible for those records. This quick video explains how. Checking new values # Access rules can be used to permit only certain changes to the document. Suppose we want Delivery people to be able to change Stage from Delivery to Done , without giving them the arbitrary rights to edit that column. We can grant them that exceptional right as follows. In the Rules for table Orders group, click the three-dot icon (\u2026), and select Add Column Rule . Set [Add Column] to Stage , and mark the U/Update permission to be granted. For the condition, use this: (user.Team.Role == 'Delivery' and rec.Stage == 'Delivery' and newRec.Stage == 'Done') This checks if the user has the Delivery role, and the record is in the Delivery stage, and that the user is trying to change the Stage to Done . The newRec variable is a variant of rec available when the user is proposing to change a record, with rec containing its state before the change, and newRec its state after the proposed change. Now, if we view the table as Kiwi, and try to change a Stage to Sourcing , we are denied: If we change a Stage to Done , it works, and the record disappears from view since it is no longer in the Delivery stage: Link keys # Sometimes it is useful to give access to a specific small slice of the document, for example a single row of a table. Grist offers a feature called \u201clink keys\u201d that can help with that. Any parameters in a Grist document URL that end in an underscore are made available to access rules in a user.LinkKey variable. So for example if a document URL ends in ....?Token_=xx-xx-xx-xx&Flavor_=vanilla , then user.LinkKey.Token will be set to xx-xx-xx-xx and user.LinkKey.Flavor to vanilla . Let\u2019s work through an example to see how that can be helpful. Suppose we have a table of Orders and we\u2019d like to occasionally share information about a single order with someone. To do that with link keys, we need some kind of hard-to-guess code for each order, which can be used to access it. Grist has a UUID() function that gives a unique, random, and hard-to-guess identifier, so let\u2019s add a UUID column with formula =UUID() : In fact we want UUID() to be called just once per order, when we create it, and never recomputed (because then it would change). So in the right sidebar we convert the formula column to a data column, freezing its values: And then we set the default formula for new records to UUID() : At this point we have a solid hard-to-guess code for each order in the UUID column, that will be created as we add new orders. It can be handy at this point to construct links to the document with that code embedded in them. Grist has a helper for this called SELF_HYPERLINK . To add a link key called <NAME> , just use this function with a LinkKey_<NAME> argument. In our case, we pass LinkKey_UUID=$UUID to embed the value of the UUID column into the URL. We also set label=$Ref to control the text label of the link in the spreadsheet. To show the link, we set the column type to Text and set the HyperLink option: Once we have these links, we can tidy up a little by hiding the UUID and Ref columns (see Column operations for a refresher on how to do this): The links don\u2019t do anything special yet, but we have everything we need to make that happen now. Here is an example of access rules to allow anyone with a UUID in their URL to read any order with a matching UUID (otherwise only owners can read orders in this case): And here is what a non-owner now sees, with the UUID of the first order in their URL: This is just the beginning of the possibilities. Link keys can give access to multiple rows across many tables. They can be used in User attribute tables . And the data they give access to can be within tables, cards, card lists, charts, and custom widgets. Access rule conditions # Accress rule conditions contain a formula expressing when the rule should apply. A blank condition will always apply. When a condition applies for an action, the permissions associated with the condition are set to allowed or denied for that action if no earlier rule in the same group has yet set them. When a condition does not apply, no permissions are set by that rule, but other rules could set them. Formulas are written in a restricted subset of Python. Variables that may be available in access rules are user , rec , and newRec . The user variable contains the following members: user.Access : one of owners , editors , or viewers , giving how the document was shared with the user (see Sharing a document ). user.Email : the email address of the user (or anon@getgrist.com for users who are not logged in). user.UserID : a numeric ID that is associated with the user. user.Name : the user\u2019s name (or Anonymous if unavailable). user.LinkKey : an object with any access control URL parameters. Access control URL parameters end in an underscore (which is then stripped). Only available in the web client, not the API. user.Origin : The content of the Origin request header. Only available in the API, not the web client. For an example of using the user variable, read Default rules . The rec variable contains the state of an individual record/row, for conditions that need to take that into account. When it is used, that rule becomes row-specific. That allows, for example, to make certain rows visible only to certain users, or to prohibit modification of certain rows by certain users. For an example of using the rec variable, read Row-level access control . The newRec variable is available for record/row creation and updating, and contains the state of a row after a proposed change, allowing you to selectively allow or deny certain changes. For an example of using the newRec variable, read Checking new values . Supported operations in condition formalas are currently: and , or , + , - , * , / , % , == , != , < , <= , > , >= , is , is not , in , not in . Supported variables are: user , rec , newRec with their members accessed with . . Strings, numbers, and lists are also supported. If an operation you need is not available, consider whether you can do part of the work in a formula in the table itself (see Access rule memos for an example). Comments are allowed, using # or \"\"\" . If there is a comment in a rule, then the first comment in a rule that results in a denial of an action will be reported to the user as a tip for why the action was not permitted. See Access rule memos for an example. Access rule permissions # A permission controls whether a user can perform a particalar kind of action. Grist access rules currently deal with 5 kinds of action, which are given single letter acronyms for convenience: R - permission to read cells. U - permission to update cells. C - permission to create rows. D - permission to delete rows. S - permission to change table structure. The S structure permission is available in the default access rule group. Column rules lack the C create and D delete permissions, which should be handled in default table rules. Note: The S permission is very powerful. It allows writing formulas, which can access any data in the document regardless of rules. Since the S permission is on by default for Editors and Owners, any such user would be able to edit a formula and so retrieve any data. In other words, having the S permission makes it possible to circumvent other rules that prevent access to data. For this reason, turning it off \u2013 as described above in Locking down structure \u2013 is an important first step in limiting data access. Access rule memos # When a user receives an error message denying them access because of a rule, it can be helpful to give specific details that will help them understand the problem. You can do this by adding a comment in the condition formula. The first comment in a condition will be passed on to the user in the event of the condition leading to a denial of access (either by matching, or failing to match). Comments are python-style, starting with a # . They can come after the formula like this: newRec.Count > 1 # No duplicates allowed Or before it, like this: # Talk to Arjun to get full access user.Access == OWNER As a full example, suppose we have a table listing airports, and we want to forbid entry of a new record with the same airport code as an existing one. In the table, we can add a formula Count that counts how many records have the same code as each other: Now, we can add an access rule to forbid any record update or creation that would result in a Count above one. We can also include a memo to explain the problem: Now if we try to add a new row with an existing code, we get a helpful error: This example also shows that sometimes the condition for an access rule needs to be expressed in two parts: a user-independent formula in the table itself (which has access to full spreadsheet functionality but does not have access to the user\u2019s identity or attributes), and a user-dependent formula in the access rule page (which has access to the user\u2019s identity and attributes, but has limits to its structure). See Access rule conditions for details on the restrictions on condition formulas, and Formulas for details on regular full-powered formulas.

We won\u2019t make such changes lightly. Every Grist document can be shared with others using the Manage Users option in the sharing menu ( ). Users can be invited as Viewers, Editors, or Owners (see Sharing a document for a refresher on those roles). Sometimes, you need more nuance about who can see or edit individual parts of a document. Access rules give us that power. Only the owners of a document can edit its access rules. When a document is loaded, owners see a tool called Access Rules in the left side bar. Click on that to view and edit access rules. The rules are also accessible via the Manage Users option of the sharing menu with the Open Access Rules button (available only to document Owners).

To do this, we add a default rule specifying that any user who is not an owner ( user.Access != OWNER ) should be denied structure permissions ( S ).

In this exercise we will show how to go about planning, designing, and creating such document. Planning # A little planning ahead will help you get a solution faster. Think about what kinds of data you are working with, and what kinds of workflows you will need. You don\u2019t need to anticipate everything when you start. You can easily add complexity later, as you\u2019ll see below. Our organization runs a number of classes for children. Each class has an instructor and multiple students. Students may enroll in multiple classes, and may return year after year. For each class, we\u2019ll want to see the list of enrolled students, and if there are spots available. When a parent calls, we want a convenient way to enroll a new student, or to change or cancel a student\u2019s enrollment. If this sounds like building an application, that\u2019s exactly what we are doing. As you\u2019ll see, however, it is no harder than building a spreadsheet. Data Modeling # The better you model your business data, the easier your work will be. In a way, you are doing database design as well as building a custom application. Grist just makes it easier. Let\u2019s start with the classes and their instructors. We need a list of classes and instructors. The same instructor can teach different classes, so instructors and classes will live in different tables. Let\u2019s call them \u201cClasses\u201d and \u201cStaff\u201d. Each class has a single instructor, so one of the properties of a class will be that class\u2019s instructor. Classes and Instructors # When starting from scratch, you\u2019ll create a new empty document (see Creating a document ), rename the initial empty table \u201cTable1\u201d to \u201cClasses\u201d, add the columns you need, and type in some classes. To follow the steps of this tutorial, you can instead import Classes.csv (or simply refer to the \u201cAfterschool Program\u201d example document). For the Staff table, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button and select \u201cAdd Empty Table\u201d. Rename it to \u201cStaff\u201d, create some columns, and enter some data about instructors. Or import Staff.csv to use sample data and save a few steps. We want the Instructor column in the Classes table to be a reference to the Staff table. Currently, the Staff table doesn\u2019t have any column that uniquely identifies each record. For setting up references, it\u2019s a good idea to add one. In this case, we\u2019ll add a \u201cFull Name\u201d column to the Staff table. Formulas # Click on the \u201cStaff\u201d page, and add a \u201cFull Name\u201d column using the column menu or the Alt + = shortcut, and type \u201cFull Name\u201d in the new column\u2019s header. Create a formula by typing in a value into any cell in the new column, starting with the equal sign (\u201c=\u201d). Enter the formula as $Last_Name + \", \" + $First_Name . You may use Excel-like syntax to the same effect: CONCAT($Last_Name, \", \", $First_Name) . In Grist, a formula always applies to every record in the table. Grist supports Python in formulas, and most Excel functions, which have uppercase names. Because formulas apply to every row, you should see the Full Name column automatically filled. References # Click on the \u201cClasses\u201d page again, and open \u201cColumn Options\u201d for the Instructor column. We\u2019ll turn it into a reference to Staff . In the right-side panel, set the column type to \u201cReference\u201d (in database terms, this is known as a \u201cforeign key\u201d), and set the referenced table to \u201cStaff\u201d. For the \u201cSHOW COLUMN\u201d dropdown, select \u201cFull Name\u201d, which is the new column we just added. Click the \u201cApply\u201d button to complete this change of the column\u2019s type (if the column is empty, there is no confirmation step). You can now assign an instructor to any class. Click on a cell in the Instructor column. You can hit Enter and choose from among the available instructors in the Staff table, or start typing to use auto-complete. Next, we will continue with students and their enrollments. Students # Each class has a number of students. So, we\u2019ll need a table of students. Again, add a new empty table, rename it to \u201cStudents\u201d, and fill it with the students\u2019 names, grade levels, etc. Or import Students.csv to use sample data and save a few steps. Let\u2019s add here a \u201cFull Name\u201d formula column, just like in the Staff table. It will come in handy. Many-to-Many Relationships # A student can take more than one class. Let\u2019s remember also that there are classes in the past and in the future, and keeping this historical data is valuable. So, for each student, there may be multiple classes, and in each class, there are multiple students. A good way to model such a relation is by adding the concept of an \u201cenrollment\u201d and a new Enrollments table. An \u201cenrollment\u201d represents one student being enrolled in one class. It has some useful properties of its own: the enrollment status (Confirmed, Waitlisted, or Cancelled), whether they have paid for the class, and perhaps more. In database design, this is known as a \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationship. The extra table is known as a \u201cjoin\u201d table. Essentially, it adds a record for each student-class connection, and turns the \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationship into two \u201cone-to-many\u201d relationships. This relationship: becomes this: So, let\u2019s add a new table, name it \u201cEnrollments\u201d, and add the columns we need. Here too, to follow along, you may import sample data from Enrollments.csv . In Column Options for the column Student , set the Column Type to \u201cReference\u201d, set the referenced table to Students , and select \u201cFull Name\u201d as the column to show. For the column Class , set the Column Type to \u201cReference\u201d, the referenced table to Classes , and select \u201cClass Code\u201d as the column to show. It\u2019s possible to enter enrollment data by adding records to this table and using auto-complete in the Student and Class column. Below, we will set up a much more convenient way to enroll students. Class View # One of our goals in the Planning stage was to see a list of enrolled students for each class. Now that the data tables are in place, we can create a page that does this. Click \u201cAdd New\u201d, then \u201cAdd Page\u201d to open the widget picker. Select to show a table of Classes , and click \u201cAdd Page\u201d. The new page shows a list of classes. Let\u2019s rename this page \u201cClass View\u201d. Next, add the Enrollments table linked to the table of classes. Click \u201cAdd New\u201d again, then \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In the widget picker, select to show a table of Enrollments . For \u201cSELECT BY\u201d, choose \u201cCLASSES\u201d, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. We get two tables side-by-side. Selecting a class shows all enrollments in that class, each of which references a particular student and includes some other enrollment info. We can go a step further to make this view convenient for us. Let\u2019s add a Class card to this view. Click \u201cAdd New\u201d and \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In the widget picker, select widget \u201cCard\u201d for the Classes data. For \u201cSELECT BY\u201d, choose \u201cCLASSES\u201d again, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. We can similarly add a card for the instructor leading this class. Again, click \u201cAdd New\u201d > \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, and select \u201cCard\u201d for the Staff data. For \u201cSELECT BY\u201d, you can now pick \u201cCLASSES \u2022 Instructor\u201d. You can change the look of the new cards. Click the three-dot menu on the top right of the Card you\u2019d like to change, and choose \u201cWidget options\u201d. Find the \u201cTheme\u201d dropdown in the right panel, and select \u201cCompact\u201d. Here is what we now have in Class View page: It\u2019s a good time to clean up this page by hiding columns and fields that are duplicated or distracting. Check out Configuring field lists for an efficient way to select which fields to show, and Custom Layouts for rearranging widgets on the page. Enrollment View # Our other stated goal was a convenient way to enroll a student, and to see or adjust a given student\u2019s enrollments. Let\u2019s add a page for this. Click \u201cAdd New\u201d > \u201cAdd Page\u201d, and select a table of Students . We\u2019ll rename the new page to \u201cEnrollment View\u201d. When we select a student here, we\u2019d like to see all enrollments for this student. So click \u201cAdd New\u201d > \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, and add a table of Enrollments . To link the new widget to the Students widget in the page, set the \u201cSELECT BY\u201d dropdown to \u201cSTUDENTS\u201d, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. Now you can click on a student\u2019s name on the left and see the classes that student is enrolled in on the right. You can enroll the selected student into a class by simply entering a class code in the special blank row at the bottom of the enrollments list. As usual, the Class reference column offers auto-complete. You can hide the \u201cStudent\u201d column in \u201cENROLLMENTS\u201d table, since it will always show the selected student anyway. If you\u2019d like to include more info about the classes in the Enrollments table, select Column Options for the Class column, and click \u201c+ Add Column\u201d in the side panel. Any of the fields associated with a class are available. If you examine the columns you add this way, you\u2019ll see that they are simply formulas of the form $Class.Times . Adding Layers # If you are working with children, you are talking to their parents. You\u2019ll need to have the parents\u2019 names and contact info, which you can add as columns to the students table. You\u2019re likely to find that some parents have multiple children that enroll in classes together. Recognizing the parent-child relationship in your database may seem like a complex step, but it will likely simplify your daily workflow. So, let\u2019s add one more table: Families . We\u2019ll include the parent name and contact info, and link each child to a record here. You can import sample data from Families.csv . Note that we added a Full Name column here as for other tables that list people. In the Students table, we\u2019ll add a column named \u201cFamily\u201d, and make it a Reference to Families . The example data already has families filled in, and conversion to reference looks up the text to set correct references. If you were entering new data, you could link students to families using auto-complete as with other reference columms. Let\u2019s change our \u201cEnrollment View\u201d to list families first. This way, when a parent calls, you can pick the right record and see all of their children and enrollments for each child. In the \u201cEnrollment View\u201d page, click \u201cAdd New\u201d > \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. Select to show a table of Families . Rearrange the widgets to have Families on the left, and Students and Enrollments to the right of it. Now link students to Families: click the three-dot menu on the top right of the STUDENTS table, and choose \u201cData Selection\u201d. In the side panel, you can set \u201cSELECT BY\u201d widget to \u201cFAMILIES\u201d. Finally, you can add Card widgets for details of the selected family, and of the selected student, and rearrange the widgets on the page to create a layout that\u2019s perfect for talking to a parent. You select a parent, see their children, and then select a child to see their enrollments. It\u2019s easy to add an enrollment record for a new class, or to change a record (e.g. mark it as \u201ccancelled\u201d), to add another child, or to add a new family. Example Document # The \u201cAfterschool Program\u201d example includes everything described above and a bit more. In particular, it adds a Count field to Classes to calculate the number of enrolled students, and a Spots Left field to show the number of spots remaining, by comparing Count to Max_Students : The formula for Count is len(Enrollments.lookupRecords(Class=$id, Status=\"Confirmed\")) . The formula for Spots Left is max($Max_Students - $Count, 0) or \"Full\" . These make for a more useful Class View page, where it\u2019s now easy to see at a glance which classes have spots remaining.","title":"Manage business data"},{"location":"afterschool-program/#how-to-manage-business-data","text":"Grist shines when your business data has some complexity.

For example, to filter column pet for values cat and dog , the filter would be {\"pet\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"]} . JSON contains characters that are not safe to place in a URL, so it is important to url-encode them. For this example, the url-encoding is %7B%22pet%22%3A%20%5B%22cat%22%2C%20%22dog%22%5D%7D . See https://rosettacode.org/wiki/URL_encoding for how to url-encode a string, or https://www.urlencoder.org/ to try some examples. Multiple columns can be filtered. For example the filter for pet being either cat or dog , AND size being either tiny or outrageously small , would be {\"pet\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"], \"size\": [\"tiny\", \"outrageously small\"]} . sort string Example: sort=pet,-age Order in which to return results. If a single column name is given (e.g. pet ), results are placed in ascending order of values in that column. To get results in an order that was previously prepared manually in Grist, use the special manualSort column name. Multiple columns can be specified, separated by commas (e.g. pet,age ). For descending order, prefix a column name with a - character (e.g. pet,-age ). To include additional sorting options append them after a colon (e.g. pet,-age:naturalSort;emptyFirst,owner ). Available options are: choiceOrder , naturalSort , emptyFirst . Without the sort parameter, the order of results is unspecified. limit number Example: limit=5 Return at most this number of rows. A value of 0 is equivalent to having no limit. header Parameters X-Sort string Example: pet,-age Same as sort query parameter. X-Limit number Example: 5 Same as limit query parameter.

In the database world this is similar to a foreign key. In the spreadsheet world this is similar to a VLOOKUP , but much more powerful and easier to use. In this guide we\u2019ll use the term underlying table for the table that lists all available values, and referencing table for the table that uses those values. Creating a new Reference column # Suppose we have a document with two tables, Clients and Projects. The Clients table lists our clients - names, contacts, signing dates - and the Projects table lists projects we do for clients. There are all sorts of things Grist can do for us if we let it know that the Client column in the Projects table is referring to clients listed in the Clients table. We can do this by converting the Client column to a \u201creference column\u201d. Open the Column Options side panel (see Specifying a type ) and set the \u201cColumn Type\u201d to \u201cReference\u201d. Adjust the \u201cData from Table\u201d option to be the correct table you want to cross-reference, and the \u201cShow Column\u201d option to match which column of that table you\u2019d like to show. Then hit \u201cApply\u201d when you\u2019re happy with the result. Understanding the reference The column value always references the entire record in the underlying table. The displayed value can be any column from that record, as selected in Show Column . You can also include additional columns to display as explained later. In our example, you can see little link icons appearing in the Client column cells, showing that they have been successfully cross-referenced with the Clients table. Once the column type is set, you can start typing into it or double-click it to see a dropdown list of all available values. Note that the table Clients and the column Client are related by the column type rather than by name. They can be named anything. Spotting reference columns You can tell that the values in a column represent a reference by the link icon that appears next to the values. If you accidentally type in a value that is not present in the Clients table, its value will be highlighted as invalid: Adding values to a Reference column # Sometimes it\u2019s useful to add a new value to the dropdown list without having to switch to the underlying table. Reference columns make it easy! Just type in the value you want add and select the + value in the dropdown list. Grist will automatically add a new record containing this value to the underlying table and insert the proper reference: Converting Text column to Reference # When working with existing data, it\u2019s common to have existing text values that should really be reference values. Don\u2019t worry, conversion is simple! Just change the column type to Reference and Grist will automatically find and substitute matching values for references. If some values are not found, they\u2019ll be shown as invalid. You can then either add them to the underlying table or select the proper values for them. In this example, the first three values match perfectly, but Forest Labs is invalid because it doesn\u2019t exist in the Clients table: Including multiple fields from a reference # A big benefit of reference columns is that they allow you to easily bring in multiple columns from the underlying table. In our example, if you wanted to bring in $Client.Contact to the Projects table, you can just select the Contact column from the Add Reference Columns section and it will be automatically added to the Projects table: If you\u2019re comfortable using formulas, you can see that the added column is just the formula =$Client.Contact . If you were so inclined, you could achieve the same result by manually adding the formula column. You can also use any other fields from Clients table by referencing $Client in formulas in the Projects table. Note that in formulas, we use the name of the reference column ( $Client ) to refer to a linked record, not the name of the table (which is Clients here). Don\u2019t let the similarity of the names in this example confuse you. Using references in formulas You may have noticed that the underlying table is Clients (plural) but the formula is $Client.Contact (singular). That\u2019s because the formula refers to the referencing column, not the underlying table. In our example, the referencing column is Client . Creating a new Reference List column # So far our example has only dealt with projects that have a single client. Suppose that we also have projects with multiple clients, and we\u2019d like to maintain references to them all from the Client column of the Projects table. We can let Grist know that the Client column contains multiple references by changing its type to \u201cReference List\u201d. This column type can reference multiple records, and can also be thought of as a multi-select. Open the Column Options side panel (see Specifying a type ) and set the \u201cColumn Type\u201d of Client to \u201cReference List\u201d. Grist will automatically convert any of your existing references to reference lists. Once you\u2019re happy with the result, just hit \u201cApply\u201d and the Client column will be ready to accept as many clients as your projects need. Editing values in a Reference List column # To make changes to a Reference List cell, simply double-click the cell or press the Enter key after you have selected the cell you want to edit. You can also start typing after selecting a cell if you\u2019d like to write over any existing contents. Doing so will open an editor like the one in the example below. Like with Reference columns, the autocomplete menu will populate with suggestions as you type. If you type in a value that\u2019s not present in the referenced table, you can select the + value to add a new row to the referenced table with your value. To delete existing references, simply press the Backspace key, or move your cursor over a reference and click the X icon.

After a second or two, you\u2019ll be able to drag the entire column to its new location. Another way to reorder columns is via the widget options: In the visible columns section, the columns can be dragged around freely to reorder them. You can also hide columns here. Renaming columns # You can rename columns in several ways. One way is to click on the column header when the column is already selected.

Specifying a type # Grist columns have types, similar to other spreadsheets or databases. The type of a column controls its appearance and the help Grist will offer you when editing cells. When you create a new column, it initially has the Any type. When you enter the column\u2019s first cell, Grist tries to narrow this type. If you enter a number, the column will be changed to Numeric type, which is right-aligned by default. If you enter something that doesn\u2019t look like a number, the column will be changed to Text type, which is left-aligned by default. To inspect the type of a column, hover over the column header, then click on the drop-down, then select \u201cColumn Options\u201d. The \u201cColumn Type\u201d section is what you are looking for. You will often want to control the column type manually. You can change it in the \u201cColumn Type\u201d section. For example, here we set a column full of \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d responses to be of type Toggle : One advantage of doing so is that Grist can now offer you ways to visualize the column that are specialized to on/off style values. Each column type has different options in the \u201cCell Format\u201d section of the side panel: Regardless of the column type, you can enter any value in cells. If a value entered is incompatible with the defined type, the cell will be highlighted with an error (and columns referencing the invalid value will also display an error): Supported types # Grist supports the following types: Type Description Text ( Default ) Any string of text. Numeric Floating point numbers. Integer Integers (whole numbers). Toggle Boolean (True / False) Date Valid date (without a time component). DateTime Valid date + time. Choice Single value from a list of pre-defined valid values. Choice List Multiple values from a list of pre-defined valid values. Reference A reference column to another table. Reference List A list of references to another table. Attachment Cells where you can place files or images. Text columns # You can put any text you like in this type of column. For formatting, you can control alignment and word-wrap, text color and background color. If the column is used for storing web links, you can turn on \u201cHyperLink\u201d formatting to make links prettier and to include a clickable link icon. Hyperlinks # When a Text column uses \u201cHyperLink\u201d formatting, values get formatted like so: https://getgrist.com will show https://getgrist.com . Grist Labs https://getgrist.com will show Grist Labs (linking to \u201chttps://getgrist.com\u201d with \u201cGrist Labs\u201d as the text). Email Help mailto:support@getgrist.com will show Email Help , a link which would open an email program to compose an email to support@getgrist.com.

Link formatting is particularly useful when links are generated using a formula such as: $Company + \" \" + $Website Numeric columns # This type is for numbers, including floating-point numbers. In addition to controlling alignment and color, you can choose the number format, and the minimum and maximum number of digits to show after the decimal point. Choosing the \u201cSpinner\u201d option for CELL FORMAT will show arrows in each cell for increasing/decreasing the number. The options under NUMBER FORMAT include: $ : Format for currency amounts, such as dollars or euro. Selecting the $ will add a currency prefix, thousands separators, and default to 2 digits after the decimal point. It will also open a currency selector for international currencies. Tip: You can set a document\u2019s default timezone, locale, and currency in Document Settings. , : Turn on the display of thousands separators. % : Show numbers as percentages. E.g. \u201c0.5\u201d would show as \u201c50%\u201d. Exp : Show numbers in exponential (or scientific) notation. E.g. \u201c1234\u201d would be shown as \u201c1.234E3\u201d. (-) : Show negative numbers in parentheses, without a leading minus sign. This is commonly used in accounting, and usually combined with $ or , formats. Integer columns # This is strictly for whole numbers. It has the same options as the numeric type. Toggle columns # This type is for storing true/false values. The values can be shown as text, checkboxes, or switches. See also example in Specifying a type . Date columns # This type is for storing calendar dates (without a time of day component). More details in Working with dates . You can choose the format for dates, see the date formatting reference . DateTime columns # This type is for storing calendar dates plus time of day. More details in Working with dates . You can choose the format for dates, see the date and time formatting reference . You can also specify the timezone to display for. Choice columns # This type is for storing one of a set of valid values, where you get to specify the available values. There\u2019s an example of using this type of column in the Lightweight CRM example . If you start off with a populated text column, Grist will take all unique values from that column as the valid choices. You can add or remove choices by either clicking Edit or on the Choices box. To add a choice, type its value in the text field below the other choices and press Enter . To remove a choice, click the delete icon to the right of the choice or select the choice by clicking on it, and then press Backspace / Delete . To apply/save your changes, you can either click the Save button or press Enter . To discard your changes, you can either click the Cancel button or press Escape . Clicking the color dropdown to the left of a choice will open a color picker for customizing the fill and text color of a choice. Changes to colors are reflected inside cells and throughout the rest of your document once you save your changes. Choices can be re-arranged by clicking and dragging them, which determines the order in which they appear when typing into a cell. You can also rename a choice by clicking on it and typing a new name. Renaming a choice will also rename all the values that are used in your document. The configuration editor supports many convenient keyboard shortcuts. You can press the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to navigate between selected choices; hold the Shift key to bulk select adjacent choices while clicking or using the arrow keys; and hold the Command / Control key to multi-select choices while clicking. To select all choices, you can press Command / Control + A . Undo and redo are also supported in the configuration editor. While your cursor has focus on the editor text field, you can press Command / Control + Z to undo your last change, and Command / Control + Shift + Z to redo it. The configuration editor also supports copy and paste. To copy, select the choices you want copied and press Command / Control + C . To paste, focus on the text field and press Command / Control + V . Choices are pasted in bulk if the clipboard contains multiple lines of text. Choices can also be copied from one column\u2019s configuration editor and pasted into another, which will copy over both the values and their configured colors. When typing into a Choice column cell, your configured choices will be shown in an autocomplete menu. You can either click on a choice, or use the arrow keys and Enter to add a choice to a cell. If your input is not one of the valid choices, Grist will display a menu option for conveniently adding it as a valid choice and into the cell in one step. Choice List columns # This type is for storing multiple values from a set of valid values, where you get to specify the available values. If you start off with a populated text column, Grist will take all unique values from that column as the valid choices. Choice List columns are configured the same way Choice columns are, and support the same level of customization and keyboard shortcuts. They differ in the number of choices they allow to be entered in each cell. While Choice columns only allow at most one value in a cell, Choice List columns allow many. Like with Choice columns, when typing into a Choice List column cell, the valid choices will be shown in an autocomplete menu. Once you\u2019ve selected a value, you can continue adding choices to the same cell. Choices can be re-arranged inside their cells by clicking and dragging them while the cell is being edited. You can also use the arrow keys and the Delete key to navigate and delete choices, or simply click the delete icon when hovering your cursor over a choice. Reference columns # This sets up a cross-reference to another table. You can specify the table to reference, and a column within that table to show.

Layout: Charts dashboard # If you have many charts, you can just lay them out in a grid to create a top-level dashboard. For dynamic charts in which data is selected by another table, a layout like List-and-detail above would work well.

The first is the Date column type, which represents a calendar date, with no time of day, and not associated with any particular timezone. The second is the DateTime column type, which represents a calendar date with a time of day which can be linked with a timezone. The Date and DateTime column types support different formatting options. When a column is set to be a Date or a DateTime , a date-picker widget will let you select the date on a calendar when editing a cell. When working with dates in formulas, the dates are Python datetime objects . That allows you to do some powerful things, but can be unexpected if you\u2019re not familiar with them. Making a date/time column # For a general introduction to setting the type of columns, see Columns and data types . To tell Grist that you intend to enter only date/times in a column, over on the header for the column, find the drop-down, and select \u201cColumn Options\u201d. Then in the side panel that opens on the right, pick \u201cDate\u201d from the \u201cColumn Type\u201d drop-down. Or, if you want dates with times, pick \u201cDateTime\u201d. Then you can choose your preferred date/time format. For the \u201cDateTime\u201d type, you can also choose the timezone. When you convert a column from another type, such as \u201cText\u201d, you\u2019ll see a preview of the conversion results, and will need to click \u201cApply\u201d to complete conversion. You can come back and change settings at any time. Now when you edit a cell in this column, you will have help for selecting dates and times. Inserting the current date # You can insert the current date in a cell using \u2318 + ; (semicolon) (Mac) or Ctrl + ; (Windows). You can insert the current date and time using \u2318 + Shift + ; (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + ; (Windows). When editing a date cell, the date entry widget has a \u201ctoday\u201d button for today\u2019s date. Parsing dates from strings # The DATEVALUE function converts a string that represents a date into a datetime object. It\u2019s simple to use and it will auto-detect different date formats: You can also use Python\u2019s datetime library, which provides two helpful functions: strptime() and strftime() . For example, let\u2019s say you have a table of movie sequels and their release dates (as strings). You\u2019d like to parse out the actual date to be able to sort the table properly. Here\u2019s how you would do that: First line imports the datetime library The second line splits the string into two parts and returns the second part (Python arrays are zero-based). The third line uses Python\u2019s strptime function to parse the date (e.g. \u201cMay 19, 1999\u201d) into a datetime object. The first parameter to the function is the string to parse, the second parameter is the date format that the string is in. Take a look at the format options to see if the example format string %B %d, %Y makes sense. (Note: You could\u2019ve also used DATEVALUE(d) to achieve the same result.) The result has a true date column and can now be properly sorted chronologically, with \u201cA New Hope\u201d at the top. For historical reasons, the first Star Wars movie is considered to be Episode 4. And, because the column type is selected as a date, you can use the \u201cDate Format\u201d in \u201cColumn Options\u201d to select the format in which to display the date. For some situations, you may wish to use the dateutil python library. For example, if you live in an area where dates typically start with the day and then the month, you could use this formula: import dateutil dateutil.parser.parse($date_text, dayfirst=True) Date arithmetic # Once you have a proper date column, often you\u2019ll want to do date arithmetic such as calculating the difference between two dates. The simplest way to do this is to use the DATEDIF function which takes two dates and the unit of information to return (Days, Months, or Years). You could also use the minus sign to subtract two dates, but you might be surprised at the result: This happens because subtracting two datetime objects as we did in the example above, results in a datetime.timedelta object which represents, \u201cA duration expressing the difference between two date, time, or datetime instances to microsecond resolution.\u201d In Grist (and Python) you have to be more specific above how you want to display the date difference. For example, to get the number of days from the returned timedelta object, use its .days property: If you want weeks or years, just divide by 7 or by 365. (Divide by 7.0 or 365.0 to include a fractional part in the result.) If you want hours, multiply by 24. You can also use specific functions to get what you want. For example, DAYS is a common function in spreadsheet apps that returns the difference between two dates: DAYS($Last_day, $First_day) Excel/Sheets formulas Grist supports many other common functions from other spreadsheet apps, including DATEADD , DATEDIF , DATEVALUE , MONTH , HOUR , and many more . Getting a part of the date # You\u2019ve seen how to parse the date, display it in different formats, and do date arithmetic. But what if you want to get more information about a specific date, such as getting its day of the week? One option is to use the WEEKDAY function, which behaves as it does in Excel, returning 1-7 for Sunday-Saturday. Alternatively, we can use the strftime function: Yet another option would be to reformat the date using Date Format in Column Options (see the date formatting reference ). Time zones # Values in DateTime columns represent moments in time. The same moment will look different in different timezones. In Grist, the timezone is set on each DateTime column. For instance, if the timezone is set to \u201cAmerica/New_York\u201d, it will show the values in New York timezone to collaborators anywhere in the world. A Grist document has a global timezone setting, which serves as the default timezone for when you create a new column of type DateTime . This global timezone is set to your local timezone when you first create a document. You can see or change it by clicking on your profile picture or icon, and selecting \u201cDocument Settings\u201d. If you insert the current date and time using \u2318 + Shift + ; (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + ; (Windows) into a DateTime column, it will be inserted as a true timezone-aware timestamp, and shown with the timezone set for that column. If you do the same in a Text column, the date/time will be inserted as the text appropriate for the document\u2019s global timezone setting. Similarly, inserting the current date into a Date column will produce the current date according to the document\u2019s timezone.

If you\u2019ve used spreadsheets before, or database expressions, you\u2019ll be on familiar territory - but there are some wrinkles you\u2019ll want to know about, so hang around. Let\u2019s start with a classic use of spreadsheets. Suppose you have a list of products you\u2019ve ordered, the quantity you ordered, and the unit price of each. You\u2019ve made a column to show the quantity times the unit price, but want the computer to do that part for you. Just select a cell in the column you want to fill, and hit = key to tell Grist you want to enter a formula, rather than a value. Did you notice, when you did that, the labels of the columns changed a little? \u201cProduct\u201d became \u201c$Product\u201d, and \u201cUnit Price\u201d became \u201c$Unit_Price\u201d. This is Grist telling you how to refer to those columns in your formula. Just type $Quantity * $Unit_Price . You\u2019ll find an auto-complete feature ready to help you. Or if you don\u2019t like typing, click on the Quantity column, type the multiplication symbol, and then click on the Unit Price column. Your formula should look like this: To control the column ID, like \u201c$Unit_Price\u201d, that\u2019s used in formulas, see Renaming columns . Press Enter , and your formula is applied to all cells in the column. If you\u2019ve worked with spreadsheets before, you may be surprised that you don\u2019t need to specify row numbers, like B1 * C1 . In Grist, a single formula applies to a whole column. You don\u2019t have to worry about filling it in for all rows, and can refer to values in the same row without fuss. Column behavior # When we provide a formula for a column we tell Grist to update its value on every change in a document. We can no longer type a value into the cell, because its value is determined purely by the formula. A formula column is one of three possible column behaviors, which you can control using the COLUMN BEHAVIOR section in the creator panel: Data column maintains data, which you can manually update or clear, or optionally calculate using trigger formulas . Formula column always reflects the result of formula calculation, and is kept up-to-date by Grist. Empty column is a state for a new column. Typing any value into it will turn it into a Data Column, while typing in a formula will turn it into a Formula Column Using the COLUMN BEHAVIOR section, you can manually change the column behavior. The most common options are available as green action buttons at the bottom, and other options are available under the behavior menu. Depending on the current column behavior, those are: Set formula action converts an empty column to a formula column. Set trigger formula or Convert to trigger formula action sets a trigger on a column (more on triggers in the next Trigger formulas section ). Make into data column action converts an empty column to a regular data column. Convert column to data converts a formula column to regular data column (you can read more about this feature in the Freeze a formula column section ). Clear and make into formula clears all the data in a column and converts it to a formula column. (We say \u201cclear\u201d as a reminder that existing data in the column will be lost. They\u2019ll be replaced by the calculation results from the formula.) Clear and reset clears all data and completely resets the column to its initial Empty Column state. Python # Grist formulas are written in Python, the most popular language for data science. The entirety of Python\u2019s standard library is available to you. For those with a spreadsheet background, we\u2019ve also added a suite of Excel-like functions, with all-uppercase names. Here\u2019s the full list of functions . Grist documents may use Python 2 or Python 3, see our Python guide for details. Formulas that operate over many rows # If you are a spreadsheet user, you may find yourself wanting to have some special rows at the end of your table that have formulas different to the rest. In Grist, we\u2019d like you to consider adding a widget to your page instead. For common use cases, Summary tables may be exactly what you need. Or if you want to set things up yourself, you can add an extra table widget like this (see Page widgets for details): This is just another table, giving us a place to put formulas outside of the structure of the Materials table. For example, if we wanted to count how many products there are in that table, we could use this formula: len(Materials.all) Every table in your document is available by its name in formulas, as a UserTable . This formula uses the all method to access the rows of the table, but doesn\u2019t do anything with them but count them. Here\u2019s a formula to compute the average price, using the Excel-like function AVERAGE : AVERAGE(Materials.all.Price) The all method returns a RecordSet , which supports iterating over individual columns this way. Equivalently, we could use a Python list comprehension : AVERAGE(material.Price for material in Materials.all) If you are not familiar with Python, it is worth following a tutorial. There are thousands online, including this official one . Python will be useful to you for all sorts of data work, not just Grist. List comprehension is useful once we\u2019re doing anything nuanced. For example, here\u2019s a formula to list the names of products with a quantity greater than 80: [m.Product for m in Materials.all if m.Quantity > 80] This is a list comprehension, but now with a conditional. The result is a list, which is rendered as text in a cell. Python can help in other ways in your search for rows. For example, here\u2019s a formula to find the name of the product with the highest quantity: max(Materials.all, key=lambda m: m.Quantity).Product Formulas are case-sensitive, with Excel-like functions being all-caps ( MAX ), and regular Python generally all lowercase ( max ). For exact matches, there is a shortcut to avoid iteration called lookupRecords , or lookupOne for single matches. Just pass the the values of columns you require to be matched. For example, here is a formula to look up the product name of a material with a quantity of 52: Materials.lookupOne(Quantity=52).Product For very large tables, it is wise to use lookups as much as you can, rather than iterating through rows. Returning to our example document, you can now see how we calculated the Total Spent , Average Quantity , and Most Ordered Product columns: Column Formula Total Spent SUM(Materials.all.Price) Average Quantity AVERAGE(Materials.all.Quantity) Most Ordered Product max(Materials.all, key=lambda m: m.Quantity).Product Separating out calculations like this from the body of your data can take some getting used to, but working this way can help keep your document more organized. And it brings other advantages. For example we could switch the formatting of the summary widget via the side panel: Varying formula by row # Having a formula apply to all rows is convenient and reduces the changes of mistakes. If you need to have a column change its behavior on different rows, it is possible using a conditional in the formula. For example, here is a replacement for the Materials.Price formula that ignores the price and shows zero for products whose name ends in \u201c(Sample)\u201d: if $Product.endswith(\"(Sample)\"): return 0 else: return $Quantity * $Unit_Price Code viewer # Once you have a lot of formulas, or if you have been invited to a document and want to get an overview of its formulas, there is a code viewer available with a pure Python summary of the document. Special values available in formulas # For those familiar with Python, here are the extra values available to you in Grist: rec is the current row. The $column syntax is shorthand for rec.column . The rec variable is of type Record . table is the current table, and is of type UserTable . Tables in your document are available by their name, and are also of type UserTable . Many extra spreadsheet functions are available, see the full function list . If your table or column has a space in its name, or other characters that are awkward in Python, those characters are replaced with an underscore. Auto-complete may help you if you\u2019re not sure. You can also control the \u201cids\u201d of columns and tables in the right side panel. Freeze a formula column # If you\u2019d like to save the output of your formula as plain values, you can simply change column behavior from Formula Column to Data Column . First open the column options in the side panel: Now click on the Formula Column and select Convert column to data option. Notice that there is no = sign in the column cells any more, showing that it is no longer a formula. The cells will no longer change if other cells they used to depend on change. The original formula is saved but stays inactive. It may come useful again if you wish to convert the column back to a formula column, or use it as a Trigger Formula . The side panel has lots of other handy settings, such as cell formatting (number of digits after decimal point, color, etc). The options apply just as much to formula columns as to regular columns. Lookups # Grist functions lookupOne and lookupRecords are useful for enumerating subsets of your data. For example, suppose we added a Category column to our Materials table, and wished to list all products belonging to a specific category. We can do this using TABLE.lookupRecords , where TABLE is the table of interest, and supplying it with the column values to match. For example, Materials.lookupRecords(Category='Ship') , as here: If you are following on, see Adding a field for details of how to add a new field to a card. If you care about the order of results, lookupRecords takes an optional sort_by parameter. For example, we could use this formula to sort by the product name itself: list(Materials.lookupRecords(Category='Ship', sort_by='Product').Product) If you want to sort by multiple columns, remember that you can create a hidden formula column that combines data in any way you like, and then sort by that. The order of records returned by lookupRecords may not match the order of rows you see in a table. To get that order, use sort_by='manualSort' . This is an internal column that is updated with the manually established sort order of rows. If you find yourself doing a lot of look-ups, please consider whether Summary tables and Summary formulas might be what you are looking for. Recursion # Lookups are handy for recursive formulas. Suppose we have a table counting how many events we have per day, and want to add a cumulative sum of those event counts. One way to do that is with a formula like this: yesterday = Events.lookupOne(date=$date - datetime.timedelta(days=1)) $events + (yesterday.cumulative or 0) For clarity, we\u2019ve split this formula into two lines. The first line makes a variable pointing to the row of the day before. The second line computes the value we want in the cell. Python note: the value of the last line is automatically returned (you could prefix it with return if you like). Notice the yesterday.cumulative or 0 . For the earliest row in the table, there will be no yesterday. In this case, lookupOne returns a special empty record, for which yesterday.cumulative will be None . If you\u2019d like to simplify this formula, or find yourself using the same lookup in multiple formulas, it would be worth making yesterday a reference column . Simply add a reference column, and give a formula for it that matches how we defined yesterday here. To actually enter this formula in a cell, you\u2019d use Shift + Enter to divide the lines. Trigger Formulas # Formula columns are great for calculated values \u2013 those determined by other data in the document. It may also be useful to store independent data in a column, but still use a formula to calculate it in some situations. This is exactly what Trigger Formulas offer. It is a very powerful feature that allows you to create a Timestamp or Authorship column, recalculate your data based on a set of conditions that you decide , clean data when a new value is entered, or provide sensible default value for a column. To create a Trigger Formula column, you first need to open the creator panel and click on the Set trigger formula action. If you want to convert an existing formula, use the Convert to trigger formula action available in the COLUMN BEHAVIOR section. To control when the formula is evaluated, use the two checkbox options below: Apply to new records triggers the formula only when a new record is created (a default cell value). Apply on record changes triggers the formula when a record is updated. Applying to new records is self-explanatory, the formula will be evaluated only once when you add a new record. It is a perfect solution to provide default values to the empty cells. Second option allows you to fine grain the conditions and specify which columns, when updated, will trigger the evaluation: You probably noticed the first option Current field . At first glance, you probably wonder: \u201cWhy would I want to trigger the column on its own change?\u201d. This option allows you to react to a value that is being entered into the column, just before it is saved! In the formula editor, you have access to two variables that are not available to regular formulas: value which is the value that a user wants to enter, user which represents a user object that is making the change (you will also see this in the Access rules section). This allows you to make your application even smarter, track when a record was updated , or see who made the last change to a row . Simple examples: Ensure that the value in a column is always written in capital letters: With the trigger formula of value.upper() , the value typed into this column will be converted to upper case automatically. Format a value that the user enters to sanitize the data before saving: With the formula like value if value.startswith(\"SK\") else \"SK\" + value , the value typed into this column will always be prefixed with \u201cSK\u201d. Overwrite a default value from a referenced table: You can use a formula like value or $Client.Phone , to provide a default value from a referenced table, but still allow the user to type a new one. In each of these examples, when the user tries to modify a cell, Grist (before updating the record) will evaluate the formula and store its result in the column instead of the value provided by the user. For a detailed, real-life example read our guide on how to create time and user stamps.","title":"Intro to formulas"},{"location":"formulas/#formulas","text":"Grist has a powerful data engine to calculate the cells of your tables using formulas.

It is a very powerful feature that allows you to create a Timestamp or Authorship column, recalculate your data based on a set of conditions that you decide , clean data when a new value is entered, or provide sensible default value for a column. To create a Trigger Formula column, you first need to open the creator panel and click on the Set trigger formula action. If you want to convert an existing formula, use the Convert to trigger formula action available in the COLUMN BEHAVIOR section. To control when the formula is evaluated, use the two checkbox options below: Apply to new records triggers the formula only when a new record is created (a default cell value). Apply on record changes triggers the formula when a record is updated. Applying to new records is self-explanatory, the formula will be evaluated only once when you add a new record. It is a perfect solution to provide default values to the empty cells. Second option allows you to fine grain the conditions and specify which columns, when updated, will trigger the evaluation: You probably noticed the first option Current field . At first glance, you probably wonder: \u201cWhy would I want to trigger the column on its own change?\u201d. This option allows you to react to a value that is being entered into the column, just before it is saved! In the formula editor, you have access to two variables that are not available to regular formulas: value which is the value that a user wants to enter, user which represents a user object that is making the change (you will also see this in the Access rules section). This allows you to make your application even smarter, track when a record was updated , or see who made the last change to a row . Simple examples: Ensure that the value in a column is always written in capital letters: With the trigger formula of value.upper() , the value typed into this column will be converted to upper case automatically. Format a value that the user enters to sanitize the data before saving: With the formula like value if value.startswith(\"SK\") else \"SK\" + value , the value typed into this column will always be prefixed with \u201cSK\u201d. Overwrite a default value from a referenced table: You can use a formula like value or $Client.Phone , to provide a default value from a referenced table, but still allow the user to type a new one. In each of these examples, when the user tries to modify a cell, Grist (before updating the record) will evaluate the formula and store its result in the column instead of the value provided by the user. For a detailed, real-life example read our guide on how to create time and user stamps.","title":"Trigger Formulas"},{"location":"functions/","text":"Function Reference # Grist formulas support most Excel functions, as well as the Python programming language. The table below lists Grist-specific functions, and the suite of the included Excel-like functions. In addition, the entire Python standard library is available. For more about using formulas in Grist, see Intro to Formulas . Grist uses Python (version 3.9) for formulas. You can use nearly all features of Python (see Python documentation ). Here are some helpful notes: Python is case-sensitive, including for Grist table and column names. Excel-like functions are always in uppercase. E.g. if is a Python keyword, while IF is an Excel-like function. Compare for equality using == , in place of Excel\u2019s single = (which in Python means assignment). \u201cNot equal\u201d uses != in place of Excel\u2019s <> . You may write multi-line Python in formulas (use Shift + Enter to add lines), including statements, variables, imports, etc. Grist code runs in a secure sandbox, with no access to anything outside your document.

It is the primary means of accessing values in formulas. A Record for a particular table has a property for each data and formula column in the table. In a formula, $field is translated to rec.field , where rec is the Record for which the formula is being evaluated. For example: def Full_Name(rec, table): return rec.First_Name + ' ' + rec.LastName def Name_Length(rec, table): return len(rec.Full_Name) $Field # $ Field or rec .Field # Access the field named \u201cField\u201d of the current record. E.g. $First_Name or rec.First_Name . $group # $group # In a summary table , $group is a special field containing the list of Records that are summarized by the current summary line. E.g. the formula len($group) counts the number of those records being summarized in each row. See RecordSet for useful properties offered by the returned object. Examples: sum($group.Amount) # Sum of the Amount field in the matching records sum(r.Amount for r in $group) # Same as sum($group.Amount) sum(r.Amount for r in $group if r > 0) # Sum of only the positive amounts sum(r.Shares * r.Price for r in $group) # Sum of shares * price products RecordSet # class RecordSet # A RecordSet represents a collection of records, as returned by Table.lookupRecords() or $group property in summary views. A RecordSet allows iterating through the records: sum(r.Amount for r in Students.lookupRecords(First_Name=\"John\", Last_Name=\"Doe\")) min(r.DueDate for r in Tasks.lookupRecords(Owner=\"Bob\")) RecordSets also provide a convenient way to access the list of values for a particular field for all the records, as record_set.Field . For example, the examples above are equivalent to: sum(Students.lookupRecords(First_Name=\"John\", Last_Name=\"Doe\").Amount) min(Tasks.lookupRecords(Owner=\"Bob\").DueDate) You can get the number of records in a RecordSet using len , e.g. len($group) . UserTable # class UserTable # Each data table in the document is represented in the code by an instance of UserTable class. These names are always capitalized. A UserTable provides access to all the records in the table, as well as methods to look up particular records. Every table in the document is available to all formulas. all # UserTable. all # The list of all the records in this table. For example, this evaluates to the number of records in the table Students . len(Students.all) This evaluates to the sum of the Population field for every record in the table Countries . sum(r.Population for r in Countries.all) lookupOne # UserTable. lookupOne (Field_In_Lookup_Table=value, \u2026) # Returns a Record matching the given field=value arguments. The value may be any expression, most commonly a field in the current row (e.g. $SomeField ) or a constant (e.g. a quoted string like \"Some Value\" ). If multiple records match, returns one of them. If none match, returns the special empty record. For example: People.lookupOne(First_Name=\"Lewis\", Last_Name=\"Carroll\") People.lookupOne(Email=$Work_Email) lookupRecords # UserTable. lookupRecords (Field_In_Lookup_Table=value, \u2026) # Returns a RecordSet matching the given field=value arguments. The value may be any expression, most commonly a field in the current row (e.g. $SomeField ) or a constant (e.g. a quoted string like \"Some Value\" ) (examples below). If sort_by=field is given, sort the results by that field. For example: People.lookupRecords(Email=$Work_Email) People.lookupRecords(First_Name=\"George\", Last_Name=\"Washington\") People.lookupRecords(Last_Name=\"Johnson\", sort_by=\"First_Name\") See RecordSet for useful properties offered by the returned object. See CONTAINS for an example utilizing UserTable.lookupRecords to find records where a field of a list type (such as Choice List or Reference List ) contains the given value. Date # DATE # DATE (year, month, day) # Returns the datetime.datetime object that represents a particular date. The DATE function is most useful in formulas where year, month, and day are formulas, not constants. If year is between 0 and 1899 (inclusive), adds 1900 to calculate the year. >>> DATE(108, 1, 2) datetime.date(2008, 1, 2) >>> DATE(2008, 1, 2) datetime.date(2008, 1, 2) If month is greater than 12, rolls into the following year. >>> DATE(2008, 14, 2) datetime.date(2009, 2, 2) If month is less than 1, subtracts that many months plus 1, from the first month in the year. >>> DATE(2008, -3, 2) datetime.date(2007, 9, 2) If day is greater than the number of days in the given month, rolls into the following months. >>> DATE(2008, 1, 35) datetime.date(2008, 2, 4) If day is less than 1, subtracts that many days plus 1, from the first day of the given month. >>> DATE(2008, 1, -15) datetime.date(2007, 12, 16) DATEADD # DATEADD (start_date, days=0, months=0, years=0, weeks=0) # Returns the date a given number of days, months, years, or weeks away from start_date . You may specify arguments in any order if you specify argument names. Use negative values to subtract. For example, DATEADD(date, 1) is the same as DATEADD(date, days=1) , ands adds one day to date . DATEADD(date, years=1, days=-1) adds one year minus one day. >>> DATEADD(DATE(2011, 1, 15), 1) datetime.date(2011, 1, 16) >>> DATEADD(DATE(2011, 1, 15), months=1, days=-1) datetime.date(2011, 2, 14) >>> DATEADD(DATE(2011, 1, 15), years=-2, months=1, days=3, weeks=2) datetime.date(2009, 3, 4) >>> DATEADD(DATE(1975, 4, 30), years=50, weeks=-5) datetime.date(2025, 3, 26) DATEDIF # DATEDIF (start_date, end_date, unit) # Calculates the number of days, months, or years between two dates.

In other words, it returns true if using value directly would raise an exception. NOTE: Grist implements this by automatically wrapping the argument to use lazy evaluation. A more Pythonic approach to checking for errors is: try: ... value ... except Exception, err: ... do something about the error ... For example: >>> ISERR(\"Hello\") False ISERROR # ISERROR (value) # Checks whether a value is an error or an invalid value. It is similar to ISERR , but also returns true for an invalid value such as NaN or a text value in a Numeric column. NOTE: Grist implements this by automatically wrapping the argument to use lazy evaluation. >>> ISERROR(\"Hello\") False >>> ISERROR(AltText(\"fail\")) True >>> ISERROR(float('nan')) True ISLOGICAL # ISLOGICAL (value) # Checks whether a value is True or False . >>> ISLOGICAL(True) True >>> ISLOGICAL(False) True >>> ISLOGICAL(0) False >>> ISLOGICAL(None) False >>> ISLOGICAL(\"Test\") False ISNA # ISNA (value) # Checks whether a value is the error #N/A . >>> ISNA(float('nan')) True >>> ISNA(0.0) False >>> ISNA('text') False >>> ISNA(float('-inf')) False ISNONTEXT # ISNONTEXT (value) # Checks whether a value is non-textual. >>> ISNONTEXT(\"asdf\") False >>> ISNONTEXT(\"\") False >>> ISNONTEXT(AltText(\"text\")) False >>> ISNONTEXT(17.0) True >>> ISNONTEXT(None) True >>> ISNONTEXT(datetime.date(2011, 1, 1)) True ISNUMBER # ISNUMBER (value) # Checks whether a value is a number. >>> ISNUMBER(17) True >>> ISNUMBER(-123.123423) True >>> ISNUMBER(False) True >>> ISNUMBER(float('nan')) True >>> ISNUMBER(float('inf')) True >>> ISNUMBER('17') False >>> ISNUMBER(None) False >>> ISNUMBER(datetime.date(2011, 1, 1)) False ISREF # ISREF (value) # Checks whether a value is a table record. For example, if a column person is of type Reference to the People table, then ISREF($person) is True . Similarly, ISREF(People.lookupOne(name=$name)) is True . For any other type of value, ISREF() would evaluate to False . >>> ISREF(17) False >>> ISREF(\"Roger\") False ISREFLIST # ISREFLIST (value) # Checks whether a value is a RecordSet , the type of values in Reference List columns. For example, if a column people is of type Reference List to the People table, then ISREFLIST($people) is True . Similarly, ISREFLIST(People.lookupRecords(name=$name)) is True . For any other type of value, ISREFLIST() would evaluate to False . >>> ISREFLIST(17) False >>> ISREFLIST(\"Roger\") False ISTEXT # ISTEXT (value) # Checks whether a value is text. >>> ISTEXT(\"asdf\") True >>> ISTEXT(\"\") True >>> ISTEXT(AltText(\"text\")) True >>> ISTEXT(17.0) False >>> ISTEXT(None) False >>> ISTEXT(datetime.date(2011, 1, 1)) False ISURL # ISURL (value) # Checks whether a value is a valid URL. It does not need to be fully qualified, or to include \u201chttp://\u201d and \u201cwww\u201d. It does not follow a standard, but attempts to work similarly to ISURL in Google Sheets, and to return True for text that is likely a URL. Valid protocols include ftp, http, https, gopher, mailto, news, telnet, and aim. >>> ISURL(\"http://www.getgrist.com\") True >>> ISURL(\"https://foo.com/test_(wikipedia)#cite-1\") True >>> ISURL(\"mailto://user@example.com\") True >>> ISURL(\"http:///a\") False N # N (value) # Returns the value converted to a number. True/False are converted to 1/0. A date is converted to Excel-style serial number of the date. Anything else is converted to 0. >>> N(7) 7 >>> N(7.1) 7.1 >>> N(\"Even\") 0 >>> N(\"7\") 0 >>> N(True) 1 >>> N(datetime.datetime(2011, 4, 17)) 40650.0 NA # NA () # Returns the \u201cvalue not available\u201d error, #N/A . >>> math.isnan(NA()) True RECORD # RECORD (record_or_list, dates_as_iso=False, expand_refs=0) # Returns a Python dictionary with all fields in the given record. If a list of records is given, returns a list of corresponding Python dictionaries. If dates_as_iso is set, Date and DateTime values are converted to string using ISO 8601 format. If expand_refs is set to 1 or higher, Reference values are replaced with a RECORD representation of the referenced record, expanding the given number of levels. Error values present in cells of the record are replaced with None value, and a special key of \u201c error \u201d gets added containing the error messages for those cells. For example: {\"Ratio\": None, \"_error_\": {\"Ratio\": \"ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero\"}} Note that care is needed to avoid circular references when using RECORD(), since it creates a dependency on every cell in the record. In case of RECORD(rec), the cell containing this call will be omitted from the resulting dictionary. For example: RECORD($Person) RECORD(rec) RECORD(People.lookupOne(First_Name=\"Alice\")) RECORD(People.lookupRecords(Department=\"HR\")) TYPE # TYPE (value) # Returns a number associated with the type of data passed into the function. This is not implemented in Grist. Use isinstance(value, type) or type(value) . Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. Logical # AND # AND (logical_expression, *logical_expressions) # Returns True if all of the arguments are logically true, and False if any are false.

You may also use the value False directly. This function is provided primarily for compatibility with other spreadsheet programs. >>> FALSE() False IF # IF (logical_expression, value_if_true, value_if_false) # Returns one value if a logical expression is True and another if it is False . The equivalent Python expression is: value_if_true if logical_expression else value_if_false Since Grist supports multi-line formulas, you may also use Python blocks such as: if logical_expression: return value_if_true else: return value_if_false NOTE: Grist follows Excel model by only evaluating one of the value expressions, by automatically wrapping the expressions to use lazy evaluation. This allows IF(False, 1/0, 1) to evaluate to 1 rather than raise an exception. >>> IF(12, \"Yes\", \"No\") 'Yes' >>> IF(None, \"Yes\", \"No\") 'No' >>> IF(True, 0.85, 0.0) 0.85 >>> IF(False, 0.85, 0.0) 0.0 IFERROR # IFERROR (value, value_if_error=\u2019\u2018) # Returns the first argument if it is not an error value, otherwise returns the second argument if present, or a blank if the second argument is absent. NOTE: Grist handles values that raise an exception by wrapping them to use lazy evaluation. >>> IFERROR(float('nan'), \"**NAN**\") '**NAN**' >>> IFERROR(17.17, \"**NAN**\") 17.17 >>> IFERROR(\"Text\") 'Text' >>> IFERROR(AltText(\"hello\")) '' NOT # NOT (logical_expression) # True . Same as not logical_expression . >>> NOT(123) False >>> NOT(0) True OR # OR (logical_expression, *logical_expressions) # Returns True if any of the arguments is logically true, and false if all of the arguments are false. Same as any([value1, value2, ...]) . >>> OR(1) True >>> OR(0) False >>> OR(1, 1) True >>> OR(0, 1) True >>> OR(0, 0) False >>> OR(0,False,0.0,\"\",None) False >>> OR(0,None,3,0) True TRUE # TRUE () # Returns the logical value True . You may also use the value True directly. This function is provided primarily for compatibility with other spreadsheet programs. >>> TRUE() True Lookup # lookupOne # UserTable. lookupOne (Field_In_Lookup_Table=value, \u2026) # Returns a Record matching the given field=value arguments. The value may be any expression, most commonly a field in the current row (e.g. $SomeField ) or a constant (e.g. a quoted string like \"Some Value\" ). If multiple records match, returns one of them. If none match, returns the special empty record. For example: People.lookupOne(First_Name=\"Lewis\", Last_Name=\"Carroll\") People.lookupOne(Email=$Work_Email) lookupRecords # UserTable. lookupRecords (Field_In_Lookup_Table=value, \u2026) # Returns a RecordSet matching the given field=value arguments. The value may be any expression, most commonly a field in the current row (e.g. $SomeField ) or a constant (e.g. a quoted string like \"Some Value\" ) (examples below). If sort_by=field is given, sort the results by that field. For example: People.lookupRecords(Email=$Work_Email) People.lookupRecords(First_Name=\"George\", Last_Name=\"Washington\") People.lookupRecords(Last_Name=\"Johnson\", sort_by=\"First_Name\") See RecordSet for useful properties offered by the returned object. See CONTAINS for an example utilizing UserTable.lookupRecords to find records where a field of a list type (such as Choice List or Reference List ) contains the given value. ADDRESS # ADDRESS (row, column, absolute_relative_mode, use_a1_notation, sheet) # Returns a cell reference as a string. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. CHOOSE # CHOOSE (index, choice1, choice2) # Returns an element from a list of choices based on index. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. COLUMN # COLUMN (cell_reference=None) # Returns the column number of a specified cell, with A=1 . Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. COLUMNS # COLUMNS (range) # Returns the number of columns in a specified array or range. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. CONTAINS # CONTAINS (value) # Use this marker with UserTable.lookupRecords to find records where a field of a list type (such as Choice List or Reference List ) contains the given value. For example: MoviesTable.lookupRecords(genre=CONTAINS(\"Drama\")) will return records in MoviesTable where the column genre is a list or other container such as [\"Comedy\", \"Drama\"] , i.e. \"Drama\" in $genre . Note that the column being looked up (e.g. genre ) must have values of a container type such as list, tuple, or set. In particular the values mustn\u2019t be strings, e.g. \"Comedy-Drama\" won\u2019t match even though \"Drama\" in \"Comedy-Drama\" is True in Python. It also won\u2019t match substrings within container elements, e.g. [\"Comedy-Drama\"] . GETPIVOTDATA # GETPIVOTDATA (value_name, any_pivot_table_cell, original_column_1, pivot_item_1=None, *args) # Extracts an aggregated value from a pivot table that corresponds to the specified row and column headings. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. HLOOKUP # HLOOKUP (search_key, range, index, is_sorted) # Horizontal lookup. Searches across the first row of a range for a key and returns the value of a specified cell in the column found. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. HYPERLINK # HYPERLINK (url, link_label) # Creates a hyperlink inside a cell. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. INDEX # INDEX (reference, row, column) # Returns the content of a cell, specified by row and column offset. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. INDIRECT # INDIRECT (cell_reference_as_string) # Returns a cell reference specified by a string. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. LOOKUP # LOOKUP (search_key, search_range_or_search_result_array, result_range=None) # Looks through a row or column for a key and returns the value of the cell in a result range located in the same position as the search row or column. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. MATCH # MATCH (search_key, range, search_type) # Returns the relative position of an item in a range that matches a specified value. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. OFFSET # OFFSET (cell_reference, offset_rows, offset_columns, height, width) # Returns a range reference shifted a specified number of rows and columns from a starting cell reference. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. ROW # ROW (cell_reference) # Returns the row number of a specified cell. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. ROWS # ROWS (range) # Returns the number of rows in a specified array or range. Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. SELF_HYPERLINK # SELF_HYPERLINK (label=None, page=None, **kwargs) # Creates a link to the current document. All parameters are optional. The returned string is in URL format, optionally preceded by a label and a space (the format expected for Grist Text columns with the HyperLink option enabled). A numeric page number can be supplied, which will create a link to the specified page. To find the numeric page number you need, visit a page and examine its URL for a /p/NN part. Any number of arguments of the form LinkKey_NAME may be provided, to set user.LinkKey.NAME values that will be available in access rules.

Searches the given table for a record matching the given field=value arguments. If multiple records match, returns one of them. If none match, returns the special empty record. The returned object is a record whose fields are available using .field syntax. For example, VLOOKUP(Employees, EmployeeID=$EmpID).Salary . Note that VLOOKUP isn\u2019t commonly needed in Grist, since Reference columns are the best way to link data between tables, and allow simple efficient usage such as $Person.Age . VLOOKUP is exactly quivalent to table.lookupOne(**field_value_pairs) . See lookupOne .

Since UUID() produces a different value each time it\u2019s called, it is best to use it in trigger formula for new records. This would only calculate UUID() once and freeze the calculated value. By contrast, a regular formula may get recalculated any time the document is reloaded, producing a different value for UUID() each time. Schedule # SCHEDULE # SCHEDULE (schedule, start=None, count=10, end=None) # Returns the list of datetime objects generated according to the schedule string. Starts at start , which defaults to NOW(). Generates at most count results (10 by default). If end is given, stops there. The schedule has the format \u201cINTERVAL: SLOTS, \u2026\u201d. For example: annual: Jan-15, Apr-15, Jul-15 -- Three times a year on given dates at midnight. annual: 1/15, 4/15, 7/15 -- Same as above. monthly: /1 2pm, /15 2pm -- The 1st and the 15th of each month, at 2pm. 3-months: /10, +1m /20 -- Every 3 months on the 10th of month 1, 20th of month 2. weekly: Mo 9am, Tu 9am, Fr 2pm -- Three times a week at specified times. 2-weeks: Mo, +1w Tu -- Every 2 weeks on Monday of week 1, Tuesday of week 2. daily: 07:30, 21:00 -- Twice a day at specified times. 2-day: 12am, 4pm, +1d 8am -- Three times every two days, evenly spaced. hourly: :15, :45 -- 15 minutes before and after each hour. 4-hour: :00, 1:20, 2:40 -- Three times every 4 hours, evenly spaced. 10-minute: +0s -- Every 10 minutes on the minute. INTERVAL must be either of the form N-unit where N is a number and unit is one of year , month , week , day , hour ; or one of the aliases: annual , monthly , weekly , daily , hourly , which mean 1-year , 1-month , etc. SLOTS support the following units: `Jan-15` or `1/15` -- Month and day of the month; available when INTERVAL is year-based. `/15` -- Day of the month, available when INTERVAL is month-based. `Mon`, `Mo`, `Friday` -- Day of the week (or abbreviation), when INTERVAL is week-based. 10am, 1:30pm, 15:45 -- Time of day, available for day-based or longer intervals. :45, :00 -- Minutes of the hour, available when INTERVAL is hour-based. +1d, +15d -- How many days to add to start of INTERVAL. +1w -- How many weeks to add to start of INTERVAL. +1m -- How many months to add to start of INTERVAL. The SLOTS are always relative to the INTERVAL rather than to start . Week-based intervals start on Sunday. E.g. weekly: +1d, +4d is the same as weekly: Mon, Thu , and generates times on Mondays and Thursdays regardless of start . The first generated time is determined by the unit of the INTERVAL without regard to the multiple. E.g. both \u201c2-week: Mon\u201d and \u201c3-week: Mon\u201d start on the first Monday after start , and then generate either every second or every third Monday after that. Similarly, 24-hour: :00 starts with the first top-of-the-hour after start (not with midnight), and then repeats every 24 hours. To start with the midnight after start , use daily: 0:00 . For interval units of a day or longer, if time-of-day is not specified, it defaults to midnight. The time zone of start determines the time zone of the generated times. >>> def show(dates): return [d.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\") for d in dates] >>> start = datetime(2018, 9, 4, 14, 0); # 2pm on Tue, Sep 4 2018. >>> show(SCHEDULE('annual: Jan-15, Apr-15, Jul-15, Oct-15', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-10-15 00:00', '2019-01-15 00:00', '2019-04-15 00:00', '2019-07-15 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('annual: 1/15, 4/15, 7/15', start=start, count=4)) ['2019-01-15 00:00', '2019-04-15 00:00', '2019-07-15 00:00', '2020-01-15 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('monthly: /1 2pm, /15 5pm', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-15 17:00', '2018-10-01 14:00', '2018-10-15 17:00', '2018-11-01 14:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('3-months: /10, +1m /20', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-10 00:00', '2018-10-20 00:00', '2018-12-10 00:00', '2019-01-20 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('weekly: Mo 9am, Tu 9am, Fr 2pm', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-07 14:00', '2018-09-10 09:00', '2018-09-11 09:00', '2018-09-14 14:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('2-weeks: Mo, +1w Tu', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-11 00:00', '2018-09-17 00:00', '2018-09-25 00:00', '2018-10-01 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('daily: 07:30, 21:00', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 21:00', '2018-09-05 07:30', '2018-09-05 21:00', '2018-09-06 07:30'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('2-day: 12am, 4pm, +1d 8am', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 16:00', '2018-09-05 08:00', '2018-09-06 00:00', '2018-09-06 16:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('hourly: :15, :45', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 14:15', '2018-09-04 14:45', '2018-09-04 15:15', '2018-09-04 15:45'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('4-hour: :00, +1H :20, +2H :40', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 14:00', '2018-09-04 15:20', '2018-09-04 16:40', '2018-09-04 18:00'] Stats # AVEDEV # AVEDEV (value1, value2) # Calculates the average of the magnitudes of deviations of data from a dataset\u2019s mean.

The table below lists Grist-specific functions, and the suite of the included Excel-like functions. In addition, the entire Python standard library is available. For more about using formulas in Grist, see Intro to Formulas . Grist uses Python (version 3.9) for formulas. You can use nearly all features of Python (see Python documentation ). Here are some helpful notes: Python is case-sensitive, including for Grist table and column names. Excel-like functions are always in uppercase. E.g. if is a Python keyword, while IF is an Excel-like function. Compare for equality using == , in place of Excel\u2019s single = (which in Python means assignment). \u201cNot equal\u201d uses != in place of Excel\u2019s <> .

For example: annual: Jan-15, Apr-15, Jul-15 -- Three times a year on given dates at midnight. annual: 1/15, 4/15, 7/15 -- Same as above. monthly: /1 2pm, /15 2pm -- The 1st and the 15th of each month, at 2pm. 3-months: /10, +1m /20 -- Every 3 months on the 10th of month 1, 20th of month 2. weekly: Mo 9am, Tu 9am, Fr 2pm -- Three times a week at specified times. 2-weeks: Mo, +1w Tu -- Every 2 weeks on Monday of week 1, Tuesday of week 2. daily: 07:30, 21:00 -- Twice a day at specified times. 2-day: 12am, 4pm, +1d 8am -- Three times every two days, evenly spaced. hourly: :15, :45 -- 15 minutes before and after each hour. 4-hour: :00, 1:20, 2:40 -- Three times every 4 hours, evenly spaced. 10-minute: +0s -- Every 10 minutes on the minute. INTERVAL must be either of the form N-unit where N is a number and unit is one of year , month , week , day , hour ; or one of the aliases: annual , monthly , weekly , daily , hourly , which mean 1-year , 1-month , etc. SLOTS support the following units: `Jan-15` or `1/15` -- Month and day of the month; available when INTERVAL is year-based. `/15` -- Day of the month, available when INTERVAL is month-based. `Mon`, `Mo`, `Friday` -- Day of the week (or abbreviation), when INTERVAL is week-based. 10am, 1:30pm, 15:45 -- Time of day, available for day-based or longer intervals. :45, :00 -- Minutes of the hour, available when INTERVAL is hour-based. +1d, +15d -- How many days to add to start of INTERVAL. +1w -- How many weeks to add to start of INTERVAL. +1m -- How many months to add to start of INTERVAL. The SLOTS are always relative to the INTERVAL rather than to start . Week-based intervals start on Sunday. E.g. weekly: +1d, +4d is the same as weekly: Mon, Thu , and generates times on Mondays and Thursdays regardless of start . The first generated time is determined by the unit of the INTERVAL without regard to the multiple. E.g. both \u201c2-week: Mon\u201d and \u201c3-week: Mon\u201d start on the first Monday after start , and then generate either every second or every third Monday after that. Similarly, 24-hour: :00 starts with the first top-of-the-hour after start (not with midnight), and then repeats every 24 hours. To start with the midnight after start , use daily: 0:00 . For interval units of a day or longer, if time-of-day is not specified, it defaults to midnight. The time zone of start determines the time zone of the generated times. >>> def show(dates): return [d.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\") for d in dates] >>> start = datetime(2018, 9, 4, 14, 0); # 2pm on Tue, Sep 4 2018. >>> show(SCHEDULE('annual: Jan-15, Apr-15, Jul-15, Oct-15', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-10-15 00:00', '2019-01-15 00:00', '2019-04-15 00:00', '2019-07-15 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('annual: 1/15, 4/15, 7/15', start=start, count=4)) ['2019-01-15 00:00', '2019-04-15 00:00', '2019-07-15 00:00', '2020-01-15 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('monthly: /1 2pm, /15 5pm', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-15 17:00', '2018-10-01 14:00', '2018-10-15 17:00', '2018-11-01 14:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('3-months: /10, +1m /20', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-10 00:00', '2018-10-20 00:00', '2018-12-10 00:00', '2019-01-20 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('weekly: Mo 9am, Tu 9am, Fr 2pm', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-07 14:00', '2018-09-10 09:00', '2018-09-11 09:00', '2018-09-14 14:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('2-weeks: Mo, +1w Tu', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-11 00:00', '2018-09-17 00:00', '2018-09-25 00:00', '2018-10-01 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('daily: 07:30, 21:00', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 21:00', '2018-09-05 07:30', '2018-09-05 21:00', '2018-09-06 07:30'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('2-day: 12am, 4pm, +1d 8am', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 16:00', '2018-09-05 08:00', '2018-09-06 00:00', '2018-09-06 16:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('hourly: :15, :45', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 14:15', '2018-09-04 14:45', '2018-09-04 15:15', '2018-09-04 15:45'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('4-hour: :00, +1H :20, +2H :40', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 14:00', '2018-09-04 15:20', '2018-09-04 16:40', '2018-09-04 18:00']","title":"SCHEDULE"},{"location":"functions/#stats","text":"","title":"Stats"},{"location":"functions/#avedev","text":"AVEDEV (value1, value2) # Calculates the average of the magnitudes of deviations of data from a dataset\u2019s mean.

A field has layout properties that are meaningful within a Card, but would not be meaningful in other contexts. Import # To import into Grist means to take data from other sources (on your computer or on the internet) and place that data in a Grist document. Examples of importing include: Take a CSV file on your computer, and create a Grist document with the same content (see: start a new Grist document ). Take an Excel file on your computer, and add the data from it to an existing Grist document (see: importing more data ). Take a JSON file on the internet, and add the data from it to an existing Grist document (see: importing more data ). Calling Grist\u2019s API from a program and adding data read from another source (see: Grist API ). Page # Grist documents are organized visually into pages. Each page allows you to view or edit one or more tables. The nature of these viewers and editors (called \u201cpage widgets\u201d) is flexible, as is their layout. A single table can be viewed (or edited) from multiple widgets in one or many pages. And a single page can contain widgets for viewing (or editing) many tables. Pages are listed in the document ( in the panel on the left ). In this list, they may be rearranged and grouped, with several \u201csubpages\u201d nested within a single page. Pie Chart # This is a classic chart type , where a circle is sliced up according to values in a column. Record # A record is the data in one row of a table, comprising the data in the individual cells of that row. It has a unique identifier, usually hidden but available in formulas as id . In a Card Widget or a Card List Widget, a record is represented by a single card. Row # A horizontal series of cells in a table. Each cell in a row belongs to a different column. The data stored in a row is also called a record. Typically rows have data about different aspects a single entity, whereas columns have data about a single aspect of many entities. Series # Data from a single column shown in a Chart Widget is called a series. The same data in a Card Widget is called a field, and in a Table Widget is called a column. Sort # The order in which rows of a table are shown is called the sort order. An example of changing the sort order of a table is given in the CRM tutorial . Table # Data is stored in tables. Tables have named columns , and a sequence of rows containing values for those columns. Every row has a numeric id (available as $id in formulas) that is unique within that table.

Grist supports imports of Excel, CSV, JSON, tab-separated files and from Google Drive . To start a new Grist document, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button on the home screen and choose \u201cImport document\u201d, as described in starting a new Grist document . To add to an existing document, open that document, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button and then \u201cImport from file\u201d. By default, each imported table is added as a new Grist table, but when examining the preview dialog for an import, you have an option to change the destination to an existing Grist table. You can also import any of the same formats from a URL, using the \u201cImport from URL\u201d option. The Import dialog # When you import data into an existing document, Grist opens an import dialog to show you what will be imported. This dialog offers available import options, lets you choose whether to create a new table or add to an existing one, and shows a preview of the data. The \u201cImport options\u201d link on the top right is sometimes useful when importing delimited files. Grist guesses the settings to parse the data (such as the field delimiter), but if it guesses incorrectly, you can adjust the settings. Guessing data structure # In all cases, when you import a file, Grist makes guesses about the structure of the file. For Excel files, Grist treats each sheet as a separated table. For CSV and other delimited formats, one file becomes one table. For both Excel and delimited files, Grist tries to detect whether the headers are included and which line they occur in. If Grist detects there are no headers, it will name columns as \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, etc. Grist automatically tries to parse numbers, dates, and boolean fields to detect the most suitable type for each column. It tries to be lossless: e.g. if it marks a column as numeric, any text values in it (such as \u201cN/A\u201d) will remain in the imported table, but will be highlighted due to the type mismatch. You can always rename tables and columns after an import, as well as convert types. Import from Google Drive # Importing from a Google Drive is as easy as importing from an Excel file or a CSV file. You can either provide an URL of a file stored in the Google Drive or use a Google File Picker to choose a file from your own drive. To use a Picker, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button and choose \u201cImport from Google Drive\u201d. To import, sign in to your Google Account by clicking the \u201cSign in\u201d button and following the sign-in process. Grist will ask for a permission to read the file you will import from Google Drive. We won\u2019t read any other files on your drive \u2014 just the single file you choose to import. Once the file has been chosen, the rest of the process is the same as importing from an Excel file. In the import dialog you may configure what data to import, and which destination table to add it to. If you have an URL to a file or a spreadsheet stored on your Google Drive or a file that is publicly accessible, you can import it directly using the \u201cImport from URL\u201d option from the \u201cAdd New\u201d menu. If the file is not shared publicly, Grist will ask you for permission to read files from your Google Drive. If you don\u2019t want to allow Grist to read your files, it will open up Google File Picker where you can select the file you want to import. Import to an existing table # By default, Grist imports new data as new tables, but the Import dialog allows you to change the destination and import data into an existing table. When importing to an existing table, Grist will attempt to match the columns from your imported file to the columns in the destination table. To manually specify column matching, click the \u201cthree dots\u201d button to open a menu with a list of columns from your imported file. Click on a column name to match it to a destination column, or select \u2018Skip\u2019 to skip importing data from that column. You can also specify a formula for each imported column by clicking the gray source column field to open a formula editor. Formulas can reference one or more imported columns, and the result of evaluating the formula will be shown in the preview after closing the editor. Importing to an existing table is best suited for importing multiple datasets containing similar structure. For instance, you could import a bank statement as a new table, then import more statements from other months into the same table. For developers, the Grist API offers a more powerful way to add data to a Grist document. Updating existing records # Suppose the table we are importing to already contains some of the data in our file. We\u2019d like Grist to update these existing records rather than duplicate them. We can tell Grist to update these records by checking the \u201cUpdate existing records\u201d option, and specifying which fields to use for matching incoming data against existing records. An imported row and an existing record that have the same values for all of the selected merge fields are considered the same record. In this case, importing will update the fields of the record with the imported data. Blank values from the imported data will be skipped, leaving the corresponding fields in the original record unchanged. Note: If there are multiple imported rows that have the same values for the selected merge fields, the last row will be used for matching and updating. If there are multiple existing records that have the same values for the selected merge fields, only the first record will be updated if a matching imported row is found. Each time the merge fields are changed, Grist will generate a preview of the updates that will be made to the destination table, and display them in the preview table. Changes are highlighted as follows: New records have all of their fields highlighted in green. Updated records have red and green highlighting for any changed fields: red (with a strikethrough) for existing values from the destination, and green for new values from the imported file. Unchanged records have no highlighting. Field values that exist in the destination table, but are blank in the imported file, are distinguished by a light gray font color.","title":"Importing more data"},{"location":"imports/#importing-more-data","text":"You can import a file to start a new Grist document , or to add data to an existing document.

For Excel files, Grist treats each sheet as a separated table. For CSV and other delimited formats, one file becomes one table. For both Excel and delimited files, Grist tries to detect whether the headers are included and which line they occur in. If Grist detects there are no headers, it will name columns as \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, etc. Grist automatically tries to parse numbers, dates, and boolean fields to detect the most suitable type for each column. It tries to be lossless: e.g. if it marks a column as numeric, any text values in it (such as \u201cN/A\u201d) will remain in the imported table, but will be highlighted due to the type mismatch. You can always rename tables and columns after an import, as well as convert types.","title":"Guessing data structure"},{"location":"imports/#import-from-google-drive","text":"Importing from a Google Drive is as easy as importing from an Excel file or a CSV file. You can either provide an URL of a file stored in the Google Drive or use a Google File Picker to choose a file from your own drive.

Click on a column name to match it to a destination column, or select \u2018Skip\u2019 to skip importing data from that column. You can also specify a formula for each imported column by clicking the gray source column field to open a formula editor. Formulas can reference one or more imported columns, and the result of evaluating the formula will be shown in the preview after closing the editor. Importing to an existing table is best suited for importing multiple datasets containing similar structure.

An imported row and an existing record that have the same values for all of the selected merge fields are considered the same record. In this case, importing will update the fields of the record with the imported data. Blank values from the imported data will be skipped, leaving the corresponding fields in the original record unchanged. Note: If there are multiple imported rows that have the same values for the selected merge fields, the last row will be used for matching and updating. If there are multiple existing records that have the same values for the selected merge fields, only the first record will be updated if a matching imported row is found.

So let\u2019s sign in on the Zapier site and then visit the Grist integration page : We\u2019d like to pair Grist with Google forms. Zapier supports several form providers, and the overall process for integration is similar for them all. Just type in the provider you want. For this tutorial, we\u2019re going with Google forms.

We click the build button to start filling in the details: Since the triggering event for the integration will happen in Google Forms, we are first asked to give Zapier some access rights to your forms. Once that is done, we are prompted to confirm which spreadsheet to use: Then we specify which worksheet within the spreadsheet to use (easy if there is just one). For Zapier\u2019s benefit in a later step, it is important that there be at least one sample response already in the spreadsheet. That\u2019s the Google side done. Now for the Grist side. We are prompted to give an API key for Grist, so we set up an API key if we haven\u2019t already. To give precise access rights, we could set up a user account just for the integration, and give it access to just what it needs, and supply its API key.

Continuing our form example, where a Grist document is accumulating votes for a preferred color: now suppose that every time a new vote comes in we want to send an email summarizing which option is in the lead. We write a formula to prepare the text in a Text cell: Let\u2019s return again to the Grist integration page on Zapier. There are several mail integrations. For this example, we pick Gmail: Once we\u2019ve picked the service to connect, now we choose exactly what we want it to do. In this case, we choose that when there is a New or Updated Record (Instant) in Grist, we will Send Email in Gmail. Note the Instant there. Triggers in Zapier can be either a regular kind where Zapier periodically checks for changes (this is relatively slow), or a special \u201cinstant\u201d kind that needs special support from the triggering service but is a lot faster. Grist supports either kind of trigger, and we strongly recommend \u201cinstant\u201d if you prefer results in seconds rather than minutes, and especially if you are the sort to get anxious if someone doesn\u2019t respond to your IMs immediately. Once we\u2019ve chosen a Grist account to use as before, we can pick a table within a document to monitor. For instant triggers, we can optionally specify a \u201creadiness\u201d column . If we leave this blank, anytime a record is created or changed in the selected table, Grist will notify Zapier about it. If we set it, it should generally be to a toggle column , and Grist will notify Zapier only for records when that column is turned on.

For this example, it is fine to leave the readiness column blank. (For regular non-instant triggers, we would need to pick a specific column to monitor.

This creates an important nuance for notifications. Usually it won\u2019t be desirable to send a notification until the record is in some sense \u201cready\u201d, but when exactly is that? Grist lets the user decide for themselves, by creating a toggle (boolean) column which is turned on when the record is ready. The column can be set manually, or via a formula. This is called a readiness column. For example, if you only want to activate a trigger when columns called Name and Email are not empty, your readiness column can have the following formula: bool($Name and $Email) You would make the column take effect by supplying it in the Readiness column option described in the email alert example . Triggering (or avoiding triggering) on pre-existing records # The order of steps matters when setting up an integration that uses a readiness column. If you have existing data, think through whether you want the integration to affect all existing data or just updates and new data. For example, if you are sending data from Grist to Google Sheets using a Zapier integration, you\u2019ll probably want to send your existing data. In this case, set up and enable your Zap first with an empty readiness column, then turn on all the readiness cells. If you want to send a notification only when something is added to Grist, and not for pre-existing records, make sure your readiness cells are all turned on prior to enabling the integration, otherwise once they are turned on notifications will be sent for all of them.

In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to: Create summary tables Create and configure charts Link charts dynamically To explain these features, we\u2019ll use the sample document \u201cInvestment Research\u201d 1 . The dataset comes from Kaggle , and includes companies and investments in them up to 2013. Let\u2019s take a look at the sample document and then we\u2019ll talk about how to build it so that you can apply these tools to your own data. Exploring the example # Open the document \u201cInvestment Research\u201d, found in Examples & Templates in your Grist home page. The first thing you\u2019ll see is \u201cOverview\u201d. This page contains two charts next to two tables. The top left has a pie chart showing the distribution of investments by category. The table next to it has the same data in tabular form. Below the pie chart is a bar graph showing the total investments raised by year. It is also accompanied by the same data in the table next to it in tabular form. All these charts and tables are examples of \u201csummary tables\u201d, which we\u2019ll describe below. The next page, \u201cBreakdowns\u201d, also contains two tables and two charts, but these are linked dynamically and offer much more detailed insight into the data. On the top left is a table showing the total funding by year (the same table as we saw on the previous page). This table serves as a driver for the chart next to it. When you click on a year in the table, the pie chart updates to show the distribution of investments in that year. Similarly, the bottom table shows investments by category. When you click on any category, the line chart next to it updates to show the history of funding in that category over the years. Note how powerful this is, and how much insight you can gain from it. For instance, you can see that Advertising category has been getting a lot of investment in NY since 2007, but was overtaken by E-commerce in 2012-2013, while the Fashion category had a major spike in 2011. On the next page, \u201cCompany Details\u201d, we get to see the granular data of this dataset. Here, we see a list of companies and the categories they fall into. Each company shown has a link pointing to its listing on the Crunchbase website. Selecting a company shows a card with its details, as well as a list of all the investments it has received. This is where we begin to see the power of Grist. The original dataset is a flat spreadsheet of companies, and an even bigger spreadsheet of investments. By displaying the data graphically, the data comes alive, making it powerful and useful. How can I make this? # With Grist, presenting your own data in graphic form is a few easy steps away. Let\u2019s begin with the first step. Get the data # Let\u2019s import the raw data. We\u2019ll import two CSV files, where each will become its own table. To follow along, save the files from crunchbase_companies_ny.csv and crunchbase_investments_ny.csv to your computer first. Then, create a Grist document by importing the first file from the home page. Next, import the second table using the \u201cAdd New\u201d button and the \u201cImport from file\u201d option. In the import dialog box, finish by clicking \u201cImport\u201d on the bottom left. The tables you\u2019ve imported will be named \u201ccrunchbase_companies_ny\u201d and \u201ccrunchbase_investments_ny\u201d. Use the page menu (click on the three dots beside the file name) to rename them \u201cCompanies\u201d and \u201cInvestments\u201d. Make it relational # The power of Grist comes from giving structure to the data. Take a look at the \u201cInvestments\u201d table. Sort by the first column and you\u2019ll notice how much repetition there is: each row contains the complete company info, which both duplicates the data in the \u201cCompanies\u201d table, and is repeated multiple times when multiple investments apply to the same company. 2 The reality is that each investment applies to a single company. Each investment row only needs to contain a reference to a company, and the data specific to that investment. To make it so, find a column that identifies a company uniquely. In this dataset, the first column, \u201ccompany_permalink\u201d, does it best 3 . Click on the arrow in the column header and click \u201cColumn Options\u201d. Click on the arrow beside \u201cText\u201d under the \u201cColumn Type\u201d in the dialogue box at the right of the screen and select \u201cReference\u201d from the list. Grist will automatically suggest to make it a \u201cReference\u201d to the \u201cCompanies\u201d table, and to show the referenced company\u2019s \u201cpermalink\u201d. Click \u201cApply\u201d to save this conversion. Let\u2019s also rename this column to \u201cCompany\u201d. In Grist, duplicated data is not needed and we recommend removing it. Using the Option-Minus (Mac) or Alt-Minus (Windows) shortcut is a quick way to remove columns. After removing the columns from \u201ccompany_name\u201d to \u201ccompany_city\u201d, here\u2019s what\u2019s left: The data you\u2019ve deleted isn\u2019t lost since it was duplicated \u2013 it\u2019s still available in the \u201cCompanies\u201d table and can be used in an Investment record\u2019s formula as, e.g. $Company.company_xxx . In fact, there\u2019s a handy way to create this kind of formula. Let\u2019s create one that we\u2019ll need later. Click the header of the \u201cCompany\u201d column. In the right panel\u2019s Column tab, you\u2019ll see a section \u2018Add Referenced Columns\u2019. Click \u2018Add Column\u2019 to add the \u201ccategory_code\u201d column. A new column will be added to the table with the formula $Company.category_code . For each investment, it shows the \u201ccategory_code\u201d of the company linked to its investment record. Summarize # The powerful feature you\u2019ve been waiting for is the one that summarizes the data. To utilize this, let\u2019s add a table showing companies grouped by \u201ccategory_code\u201d. In the \u201cAdd New\u201d menu at the top left, select \u201cAdd Page\u201d. In the dialog box, select \u201cTable\u201d and \u201cCompanies\u201d, and then use the summation icon ( ) to select the \u201cGroup By\u201d columns \u2013 i.e. the columns by which to summarize. If you don\u2019t select any columns, you\u2019ll just get a single row of totals. If you summarize by \u201ccategory_code\u201d, you\u2019ll get a row for each distinct value of \u201ccategory_code\u201d. Let\u2019s do that and then click \u201cAdd Page\u201d. This is similar to Excel\u2019s pivot tables. Each row represents the group of records from the source table (\u201cCompanies\u201d) that have a particular value of \u201ccategory_code\u201d. There is a reminder of that in the table\u2019s title (\u201cCOMPANIES [by category_code]\u201d). Such summary tables can (and should!) use formulas. The columns you choose when creating the table are the identifiers of the groups. All other columns are formula columns \u2013 they are calculated. In formulas, the group of source records summarized by one row is available as the value \u201c$group\u201d. For example, you\u2019ll see a column created automatically called \u201ccount\u201d. If you hit \u201cEnter\u201d, you\u2019ll see the formula in it \u2013 len($group) \u2013 that\u2019s just the number of records in that group of records, i.e. the number of companies in that category. For numeric columns in the source table, summary tables automatically get a same-named numeric column containing a sum, with a formula such as SUM($group.funding_total_usd) . Side note for Python fans. $group is a special Python object. It\u2019s an iterable collection of records. Using an attribute like $group.A is a shorthand for the list of values in the A column of all the records in the group, i.e. it\u2019s roughly equivalent to [r.A for r in $group] . Sometimes, adding the values doesn\u2019t make sense. E.g. the sum of \u201cfounded_year\u201d is meaningless. It\u2019s best to delete this and any other column we don\u2019t need, which leaves us with the \u201cfunding_total_usd\u201d column. Since this column contains large numbers, it\u2019s a good time to look at the \u201cNumber Format\u201d section of its configuration, and click , (or perhaps $ ) to format numbers to be more readable. Let\u2019s add a second summary table. Select \u201cAdd New\u201d again to \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. To get a summary by year, select the \u201cInvestments\u201d table under \u201cSelect Data\u201d, and again use its sum symbol (\u2211) to select the column by which to summarize: \u201cfunded_year\u201d and then click \u201cAdd to page\u201d. This produces a second summary table that shows a record for each year, with each representing a group of \u201cInvestments\u201d rows for that year. The most useful column is \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d, adding all investments made in that year. Let\u2019s delete the unneeded columns. You\u2019ll notice pink values in \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d. That\u2019s because Grist guesses the column type to be an integer.The pink sums are instances where the numbers exceed Javascript\u2019s ability to handle large integers. To correct for this, the type of the column should be switched to \u201cNumeric\u201d (which trades off precision for the ability to represent very large and very small numbers). Change the type to \u201cNumeric\u201c under \u201cColumn options\u201d. This is again a good time to pick a friendlier number format for the column, and to make it wider to fit the longer numbers. Chart, graph, plot # You can make a chart of any data. To this page, we want to add a graphic version of each summary table. Select the \u201cAdd New\u201d button again, pick \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, select \u201cChart\u201d as the widget, and the same table (Companies) and summary column (category_code) as before. Then click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. For a chart, you\u2019ll always follow up by customizing it. Open the right panel, and select \u201cChart\u201d tab / \u201cWidget\u201d subtab. The \u201cVisible Series\u201d section in the subtab determines which columns of data will be used as the series in the chart. Their exact meaning depends on the chart type. For this first chart, under \u201cChart type, select \u201cPie Chart\u201d. To construct this chart, two \u201cVisible Series\u201d are required: the first one will be used as labels, and the second as values. Since we want the chart to show \u201ccategory_code\u201d as labels, and \u201cfunding_total_usd\u201d as values, those should be the two items in the \u201cVisible Series\u201d list in the configuration panel. As you move your mouse over the items in that list, use the \u201ceye\u201d icon that shows up to remove the other series from the list. Alternatively, you can select the unneeded columns using checkboxes, and click \u201cHide Series\u201d. Now add a chart showing a trend by year. Add another \u201cWidget to page\u201d, select \u201cChart\u201d under \u201cWidget\u201d, select \u201cInvestments\u201d under \u201cSelect Data\u201d, click summation ( ) to group by \u201cfunded_year\u201d, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. To customize this chart, stick with the chart type \u201cBar Chart\u201d. The list of \u201cVisible Series\u201d in the \u201cChart\u201d tab should now be adjusted: the first series will be the values for the X (horizontal) axis, and second (and possible additional) series will be the values for the Y (vertical) axis. So hide the unwanted columns (\u201ccount\u201d), and leave the \u201cfunded_year\u201d first (to serve as the X-values), and \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d second (to serve as the Y-values). You can rearrange the sections on the screen into a configuration you\u2019d like to see for a dashboard. Move your mouse to the top left of each section until you see a \u201cdrag handle\u201d icon. Use that icon to drag each section into the desired spot relative to other sections. Once you\u2019re finished, rename the page \u201cOverview\u201d. Dynamic charts # If you\u2019ve read our other tutorials on linking data, this will come naturally. Charts are simply a different way to show data, and they can be linked in the same way as tables. For our example, we\u2019ll add a new page with a summary table: select widget \u201cTable\u201d, data \u201cInvestments\u201d, group by \u201cfunded_year\u201d, click \u201cAdd Page\u201d. Let\u2019s rename this new page \u201cBreakdowns\u201d. Next, add a widget to this page, selecting widget \u201cChart\u201d, data \u201cInvestments\u201d. For \u201cGroup By\u201d, we pick two columns: \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d and \u201cfunded_year\u201d. Note: This is why we added the \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d column earlier. We can only group investment records by the category code if we have this code for each investment. The \u201cSelect By\u201d dropdown at the bottom left of the dialog box lists widgets already on the screen that can control the selection of data in the chart we are adding. In \u201cSelect By\u201d, choose \u201cINVESTMENTS [by funded_year]\u201d, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. Note: If you need to make changes to a widget you already added, such as change its type, \u201cGroup By\u201d, or \u201cSelect By\u201d settings, you can always do so from the \u201cData\u201d subtab in the widget settings, using the \u201cEdit Data Selection\u201d button. We want to be able to select a year, and then show a pie chart for that year that displays the total for each category code. The \u201cSelect By\u201d option we chose ensures that only the selected year\u2019s data is used. All that\u2019s left is to change the chart type to \u201cPie Chart\u201d, and set \u201cVisible Series\u201d to only \u201ccategory_code\u201d and \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d and hide the other data series. Note: Graphs need more screenspace, so our small screenshots will look better if we close the side panels by clicking on the opener icons ( , ). Let\u2019s also sort the table by \u201cfunded_year\u201d. As far as sorting, the highlighted button above the table reminds you that sort settings aren\u2019t saved automatically. Click the green button and select \u201cSave\u201d to do that. What\u2019s the result? We can click through the years (or use arrow keys), and see the distribution by category change. Note: If clicking through the years does not affect the chart, the chart must not be linked. You can check and correct it by using the \u201cthree dots\u201d menu on top right of the chart, clicking \u201cData selection\u201d, and ensuring that \u201cSelect By\u201d dropdown is showing \u201cINVESTMENTS [by funded_year]\u201d. To complete the example, we will add two more sections to this \u201cBreakdowns\u201d page. One will be a table listing company categories, and linked to it will be a chart showing the amount of investment in that category over the years. To add the table of categories, use \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, and select \u201cTable\u201d widget, \u201cInvestments\u201d data, grouped by \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d. The \u201cfunded_year\u201d column in the resulting table is meaningless, and should be deleted. For the last step, we add another chart. We need to remember to group by both \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d \u201cfunded_year\u201d, and to set a suitable \u201cSelect By\u201d widget for it. Since there are two tables on this page, you have a choice of which one will drive the data in this chart. In this case, pick the widget that we just added: \u201cINVESTMENTS [by Company_category_code]\u201d. As in the previous section, we configure the chart by selecting \u201cChart Type\u201d as \u201cBar Chart\u201d, and in the \u201cVisible Series\u201d list, leaving the series \u201cfunded_year\u201d (the x-axis) and \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d (the y-axis), and hiding the rest. We can now click through the categories, and see the history of investment into each one. Next steps # If you\u2019re unfamiliar with how we created the \u201cCompany Details\u201d page that\u2019s present in the example, visit one of these earlier tutorials to learn how: \u2018How to build a Lightweight CRM\u2019, or \u2018Managing your Business in Grist\u2019. That\u2019s it! Now go analyze some data! The sample document includes only the \u201ccompanies\u201d and \u201cinvestments\u201d data, and includes only New York companies to keep it smaller and faster. \u21a9 Such duplication is commonly seen in spreadsheets. Data in this form is called \u201cdenormalized\u201d. \u21a9 If you don\u2019t have a single identifying column, you can construct one with a formula. \u21a9","title":"Analyze and visualize"},{"location":"investment-research/#how-to-analyze-and-visualize-data","text":"Grist offers several powerful ways to analyze and visualize data. In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to: Create summary tables Create and configure charts Link charts dynamically To explain these features, we\u2019ll use the sample document \u201cInvestment Research\u201d 1 . The dataset comes from Kaggle , and includes companies and investments in them up to 2013.

The first thing you\u2019ll see is \u201cOverview\u201d. This page contains two charts next to two tables. The top left has a pie chart showing the distribution of investments by category. The table next to it has the same data in tabular form. Below the pie chart is a bar graph showing the total investments raised by year. It is also accompanied by the same data in the table next to it in tabular form. All these charts and tables are examples of \u201csummary tables\u201d, which we\u2019ll describe below. The next page, \u201cBreakdowns\u201d, also contains two tables and two charts, but these are linked dynamically and offer much more detailed insight into the data. On the top left is a table showing the total funding by year (the same table as we saw on the previous page). This table serves as a driver for the chart next to it. When you click on a year in the table, the pie chart updates to show the distribution of investments in that year. Similarly, the bottom table shows investments by category. When you click on any category, the line chart next to it updates to show the history of funding in that category over the years. Note how powerful this is, and how much insight you can gain from it. For instance, you can see that Advertising category has been getting a lot of investment in NY since 2007, but was overtaken by E-commerce in 2012-2013, while the Fashion category had a major spike in 2011. On the next page, \u201cCompany Details\u201d, we get to see the granular data of this dataset. Here, we see a list of companies and the categories they fall into. Each company shown has a link pointing to its listing on the Crunchbase website. Selecting a company shows a card with its details, as well as a list of all the investments it has received. This is where we begin to see the power of Grist. The original dataset is a flat spreadsheet of companies, and an even bigger spreadsheet of investments.

Each investment row only needs to contain a reference to a company, and the data specific to that investment. To make it so, find a column that identifies a company uniquely. In this dataset, the first column, \u201ccompany_permalink\u201d, does it best 3 . Click on the arrow in the column header and click \u201cColumn Options\u201d.

To complete the example, we will add two more sections to this \u201cBreakdowns\u201d page. One will be a table listing company categories, and linked to it will be a chart showing the amount of investment in that category over the years. To add the table of categories, use \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, and select \u201cTable\u201d widget, \u201cInvestments\u201d data, grouped by \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d. The \u201cfunded_year\u201d column in the resulting table is meaningless, and should be deleted. For the last step, we add another chart. We need to remember to group by both \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d \u201cfunded_year\u201d, and to set a suitable \u201cSelect By\u201d widget for it. Since there are two tables on this page, you have a choice of which one will drive the data in this chart. In this case, pick the widget that we just added: \u201cINVESTMENTS [by Company_category_code]\u201d. As in the previous section, we configure the chart by selecting \u201cChart Type\u201d as \u201cBar Chart\u201d, and in the \u201cVisible Series\u201d list, leaving the series \u201cfunded_year\u201d (the x-axis) and \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d (the y-axis), and hiding the rest. We can now click through the categories, and see the history of investment into each one.","title":"Dynamic charts"},{"location":"investment-research/#next-steps","text":"If you\u2019re unfamiliar with how we created the \u201cCompany Details\u201d page that\u2019s present in the example, visit one of these earlier tutorials to learn how: \u2018How to build a Lightweight CRM\u2019, or \u2018Managing your Business in Grist\u2019.

A good example is keeping track of contacts and our conversations with them. For a business, this could be customers, sales leads, or job candidates. For an individual, it could be companies they have applied to in a job search. In this tutorial, we\u2019ll explain the \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example, which you can use as a template for your own contacts, and then show how to build it from scratch. You\u2019ll learn how to: Add tables Link data Set column types Create custom layouts Exploring the example # Open the document Lightweight CRM , found in Examples & Templates in your Grist home page . You\u2019ll see the \u201cContacts\u201d page, listing contacts on the left of the screen. Click on any contact to select it. The two sections on the right show the details and the history of interactions with the selected contact. How does this compare to a spreadsheet? These screenshots show the Lightweight CRM example on the left, and a regular spreadsheet with the same data on the right. Previous Next Previous Next The difficulty is in the history of notes for a contact. In a two-dimensional grid, you have few options for where to include multiple notes. If you include them as multiple columns, it quickly makes the spreadsheet unwieldy and difficult to navigate. Grist feels more like an application, but it\u2019s still as versatile as a spreadsheet. The \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example can be used immediately as-is (with the sample data), or as a template (just the structure without the data). Here are a few more points on using it as a CRM: To add a new contact, click the blank row at the bottom of the contacts list, then fill in the blank \u201cCONTACTS Card\u201d section that shows on the right. To add a new conversation, select a contact, then click the blank line at the end of the Interactions table. You can enter today\u2019s date using the shortcut \u2318 + ; (semicolon) (Mac) or Ctrl + ; (semicolon) (Windows). Then select the type of interaction using auto-complete, and type in your notes. You can add To-Do items for a contact: in the Interactions list, select \u201cTo-Do\u201d in the \u201cType\u201d column as a special type of interaction. Think of the associated date as the due date for this task. The Contacts table shows the list of coming up To-Do items, sorted by their due date. If you use Gmail, the handy \u201cGmail search\u201d link in the \u201cCONTACTS Card\u201d section will open a browser window with the Gmail search results for this contact\u2019s email address. You can use this example as a template for your own contacts. With the \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example open, click the \u201cSave Copy\u201d button in in the top bar, then mark the \u201cAs Template\u201d checkbox. You\u2019ll get an empty document with the same layout, and can start filling it in with your own data. If you aren\u2019t signed in, you will need to sign in to make a copy of the example. Creating your own # The rest of this tutorial will show you how to create such a document on your own. It\u2019s a great exercise that will teach you some of the key features of Grist. To start, we\u2019ll import a file with sample contacts from the Grist home page. First, save this file to your desktop: lightweight-crm-contacts.csv . Then click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button on the top left of your Grist home page, click \u201cImport document\u201d, and select the file on your desktop. You\u2019ll see a table of contacts with sample data. Note that in Grist, columns have names. Rename this table to \u201cContacts\u201d by clicking its name in the top bar, and typing the new name. That\u2019s all you need for a simple table of contacts. You can add rows here, or add new columns to associate more data with each contact. Adding another table # For our next step, we want to be able to select a contact, and see the list of conversations with that contact. These conversations should be a new table of data. The cue is that it has a different number of rows from the table of contacts. Create the new table using the green \u201cAdd New\u201d button on the top left of your screen, and click \u201cAdd Empty Table\u201d in the menu. This table will represent interactions with our contacts, so let\u2019s rename it \u201cInteractions\u201d by clicking its default name (\u201cTable1\u201d) on top of the screen, as before. It\u2019s a good idea to give meaningful names to columns. In this case, for each interaction, we need to know which Contact it refers to, the date, type, and conversation notes. To rename a column, click its header to select the column, and click the header again to edit its name. You can hit the Tab key to continue to renaming the next column. Finally, hit the \u201c+\u201d button to the right of the last column to create one more column, and name it \u201cNotes\u201d. Linking data records # Every record in this table will belong to a particular contact. You set it up by turning the \u201cContact\u201d column into a reference to the table \u201cContacts\u201d. Using the triangle in the header of the column \u201cContact\u201d, open the menu and select \u201cColumn Options\u201d. In the right panel, use the \u201cColumn Type\u201d dropdown to select \u201cReference\u201d, then under \u201cData from table\u201d, select \u201cContacts\u201d. Each cell in this column will hold a pointer to a row in the \u201cContacts\u201d table 1 . While it refers to an entire row, it\u2019s useful to see some particular identifier of that row, so under \u201cShow column\u201d, select \u201cCompany\u201d. You\u2019ll see this in action shortly. Setting other types # In Grist, every column has a type. Often, the default of Text or Numeric is correct. For our \u201cDate\u201d column, a better type is Date. Click any cell in the \u201cDate\u201d column, and in the right panel, click into the \u201cColumn Type\u201d dropdown and select \u201cDate\u201d. If you\u2019d like, you can also choose a different date format right below the type. Now, if you click on a cell in the \u201cDate\u201d column and hit Enter, you have a convenient date picker. Another useful column type for us is \u201cChoice\u201d. Our interactions will be either \u201cPhone\u201d, \u201cEmail\u201d, or \u201cIn-person\u201d, and it\u2019s useful to list these options. Click into the \u201cType\u201d column, and in the right panel, set \u201cColumn Type\u201d to \u201cChoice\u201d. You\u2019ll see \u201cChoice Values\u201d textbox below. Click it, and enter your choices there, one per line: \u201cPhone\u201d, \u201cEmail\u201d, \u201cIn-person\u201d. Now, if you click on a cell in the \u201cType\u201d column and hit Enter, you can now choose from among the choices you set, or start typing and use auto-complete. Linking tables visually # The next step is to link the two tables visually. Open the \u201cContacts\u201d page, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button on top of the left panel, then \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. Select widget \u201cTable\u201d and data \u201cInteractions\u201d. In the \u201cSelect By\u201d dropdown at the bottom of the dialog, select \u201cCONTACTS\u201d. This means that choosing a contact will display only the interactions with that contact. Click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d to finish. Next, let\u2019s select a contact in the table on the left (let\u2019s use \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d in the fourth row) and add some notes for it. Type in a date (hint: the shortcut \u2318 + ; (semicolon) on Mac or Ctrl + ; (semicolon) on Windows inserts today\u2019s date), select a type, and enter a note. As soon as that row is created, the \u201cContact\u201d column is automatically filled with \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d, thanks to the sections being linked. The note we added is shown only when \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d is selected. We can add more notes for \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d, or add notes for any of the other contacts. We can now hide the \u201cContact\u201d column in the \u201cInteractions\u201d table: using the menu in the column\u2019s header, select \u201cHide Column\u201d. Because the tables are linked, we already see who the notes are for. For longer notes to be convenient, resize the \u201cNotes\u201d column by dragging the right edge of its header. To wrap long notes, open the Column Options, and click the line-wrapping icon. Customizing layout # Once you have multiple tables on one screen, the layout of the screen may become an issue. Having many columns in the Contacts table may no longer be convenient. It\u2019s better to lay it out like a custom application: select a contact from a list on the left and see that contact\u2019s details and interactions. This can be done by using \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d again. This time, we\u2019ll select the widget \u201cCard\u201d for the table \u201cContacts\u201d, and for \u201cSelect By\u201d will again use \u201cCONTACTS\u201d. You can move the resulting sections around to create a convenient layout. Move your mouse to the top left of each section until you see a \u201cdrag handle\u201d icon. Use that icon to drag each section into the desired spot relative to other sections. You can also resize sections by moving the mouse between them to find a dotted line. Drag this line to resize. Note how the same personal data is now shown in two places on the screen. These are not copies of data, but different presentations of the same data. Changing the data in one place will change it in the other. Customizing fields # At this point, we may do some cleanup: hide unneeded columns in the main \u201cContacts\u201d table and rearrange fields in the Card widget. A quick way to hide columns is using the right panel. Using the three-dot menu on the top right of the \u201cContacts\u201d table, select \u201cWidget options\u201d. In the panel that opens, find a list of \u201cVisible columns\u201d. Move the mouse over each column to reveal the \u201ceye\u201d icon. Click it to hide all columns except \u201cCompany\u201d. To customize the Card widget, click it. The right panel will show the relevant options. You can select a different Theme, e.g. \u201cCompact\u201d. To rearrange fields, click \u201cEdit Layout\u201d in the right panel. You can now drag-and-drop fields in the card, resize them, or remove them. Click \u201cSave\u201d once you are done. In a few short steps, we have gone from a clunky, unwieldy spreadsheet to a concise, elegant record of your interactions in a simple, effective custom application. To-Do Tasks for Contacts # The \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example has another trick up its sleeve. The \u201cType\u201d column in the interactions table has an extra choice, \u201cTo-Do\u201d. After you talk to a contact, you can add an extra note about what you need to do for the next conversation, and the date when it\u2019s due. The \u201cContacts\u201d table makes these To-Do items visible, and sortable by due date. This way you can see at a glance what\u2019s coming up next. If you are interested in the details of setting it up, expand the section below. For your first introduction to Grist, you are welcome to skip it. > Setting up To-Do tasks # To set up To-Do items as in the example, select Column Options for the \u201cType\u201d column in the Interactions table, and add another choice (\u201cTo-Do\u201d) to the list of choices: Let\u2019s pick our contact \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d and add a To-Do item: In the \u201cContacts\u201d table, add two new columns: Rename them to \u201cDue\u201d and \u201cTo-Do Items\u201d. Both columns are calculated using formulas. Grist has great support for formulas, allowing full Python syntax and many Excel functions. In Grist, a formula always applies to the entire column of data. To enter a formula, click on a cell in the \u201cDue\u201d column, and hit \u201c=\u201d key: In this formula, we want to look up all Interactions for the current Contact whose Type is \u201cTo-Do\u201d, then select the one with the earliest Date. Using Python syntax, the formula is: items = Interactions.lookupRecords(Contact=$id, Type=\"To-Do\") return min(items.Date) if items else None Paste it in, or type in. When typing in multi-line formulas, use Shift+Enter to add new lines, and Enter to save. It\u2019s also a good time to change the column type to \u201cDate\u201d. Open Column Options, and select \u201cDate\u201d for the type. You can choose the Date Format directly below the type. For the \u201cTo-Do Items\u201d, enter a formula similarly. In case of multiple To-Do items, this formula will concatenate them, separated by line breaks. Click into the \u201cTo-Do Items\u201d column, hit \u201c=\u201d to start typing the formula, and enter items = Interactions.lookupRecords(Contact=$id, Type=\"To-Do\") return \"\\n\".join(items.Notes) Now the To-Do item we entered earlier is visible in the main Contacts table. Note that the values in these columns are read-only, since they are calculated. To change the due date, find the To-Do item in the Interactions table where you created it. Sorting tables # We\u2019ll want contacts with To-Do items to show up first, in order of the Due date. Click the triangle in the header of the \u201cDue\u201d column, and select \u201cSort A-Z\u201d. By default, sorting settings are not saved. The highlighted green button in the top right of the \u201cContacts\u201d table reminds us of that. To keep this sort order when you reopen the document, save it by clicking that green button and selecting \u201cSave\u201d. You can also save by clicking the green check mark, to the right of the filter icon. Other features # Grist has more great features, some of which are used in the \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example document. To read more about those, follow the links to their documentation. Any text column may be shown as a hyperlink. Lightweight CRM example uses it twice: for the \u201cwebsite\u201d field, and for a formula-constructed hyperlink to a Gmail search page for the given contact\u2019s email. The latter is handy if you use Gmail. Grist supports attachments. In the example, there is an \u201cAttachments\u201d field for each contact that may be used to store an image of a business card, for example. In an actual business, you\u2019ll need more. Specialized CRM products have tons of features. Their problem is complexity: trying to satisfy the needs of many different clients makes for a complicated product to use. The beauty of Grist is that you can start simple and add only the level of complexity you need, and nothing more. Other tutorials show how to model more complex data, analyze and chart data, and more. In the database world, this kind of reference or pointer is known as a \u201cforeign key\u201d. \u21a9","title":"Create your own CRM"},{"location":"lightweight-crm/#how-to-create-a-custom-crm","text":"Grist is as easy to use as a spreadsheet, but gives you new powers when data doesn\u2019t fit in a simple grid.

If you use Gmail, the handy \u201cGmail search\u201d link in the \u201cCONTACTS Card\u201d section will open a browser window with the Gmail search results for this contact\u2019s email address. You can use this example as a template for your own contacts. With the \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example open, click the \u201cSave Copy\u201d button in in the top bar, then mark the \u201cAs Template\u201d checkbox.

It\u2019s a great exercise that will teach you some of the key features of Grist. To start, we\u2019ll import a file with sample contacts from the Grist home page. First, save this file to your desktop: lightweight-crm-contacts.csv . Then click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button on the top left of your Grist home page, click \u201cImport document\u201d, and select the file on your desktop. You\u2019ll see a table of contacts with sample data. Note that in Grist, columns have names. Rename this table to \u201cContacts\u201d by clicking its name in the top bar, and typing the new name. That\u2019s all you need for a simple table of contacts.

This table will represent interactions with our contacts, so let\u2019s rename it \u201cInteractions\u201d by clicking its default name (\u201cTable1\u201d) on top of the screen, as before. It\u2019s a good idea to give meaningful names to columns. In this case, for each interaction, we need to know which Contact it refers to, the date, type, and conversation notes. To rename a column, click its header to select the column, and click the header again to edit its name. You can hit the Tab key to continue to renaming the next column. Finally, hit the \u201c+\u201d button to the right of the last column to create one more column, and name it \u201cNotes\u201d.","title":"Adding another table"},{"location":"lightweight-crm/#linking-data-records","text":"Every record in this table will belong to a particular contact.

When linked, selecting a record in one widget will cause another widget to update and show only the data related to the selected record. For example, let\u2019s say you have a table of Departments in a company, and a table of Employees , with each employee tied to some department. You can have one Table widget listing departments and serving as a selector for a second Table widget listing employees: Previous Next To create this, first create a page with a Table widget for Departments data, as described in Page widgets . Then in the \u201cAdd New\u201d menu, select the \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d option to add another Table widget for Employees data. In the widget picker, use the \u201cSelect By\u201d dropdown and choose the \u201cDEPARTMENTS\u201d widget added in the first step. That\u2019s all it takes: now selecting a department in the first table will cause the second table to show only the employees in that department. Note that this relies on the Emploeees table having a column of type Reference with the target table of Departments . See Reference columns . Types of linking # Linking widgets only works when there is some relationships between records in the underlying data. There are several kinds of relationships supported. Same-record linking # Most directly you can link two widgets which show data from the same underlying table, usually linking a Table to a Card. This allows you to select a record in the Table widget and see more details of that record in the linked Card widget. For example, you can add a Card of Employees data and link it to an existing Table widget \u201cEMPLOYEES\u201d: When you select a record in the table, the new \u201cEMPLOYEES Card\u201d widget shows a card for the selected record. For another example of such linking, see the \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d document in \u201cExamples & Templates\u201d and the Customizing Layout section in the associated tutorial. Filter linking # As in the Employee-Department example, when one table has a reference to another (i.e. a column of type \u201cReference\u201d), the second table can serve as a selector for the first. Essentially, selecting a record can automatically filter another widget to show only those records that refer to the selected record. In the example shown earlier, the Employees table has a \u201cReference\u201d column pointing to the Departments table, so a list of departments can serve as a selector for employees. When a department is selected, only the employees in that department will be shown. The \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d document in \u201cExamples & Templates\u201d provides another example, where selecting a contact shows only the conversations with that contact. It\u2019s also described in the tutorial . When the target of linking is a Chart widget, you get dynamic charts that reflect data associated with the selected record. For example, you could link a pie chart to a department to show the sum of salaries for each job position in the selected department. Previous Next Indirect linking # Whenever a table A has a reference to B , A can be used in place of B as the source of linking. Instead of considering the currently selected record in A , linking will consider the referenced record in B as the selection. For instance, a Table widget showing Employees can serve as a selector for a Card widget showing data from Departments , using the fact that an employee record contains a \u201cDepartment\u201d reference. In the widget picker, if you select data from Departments , you\u2019ll see a \u201cSelect By\u201d option \u201cEMPLOYEES \u2022 Department\u201d: When you select an employee, you\u2019ll see the details of that employee\u2019s department. Multiple reference columns # When a table that\u2019s the target of linking has multiple reference columns, you may need to choose which one to use for linking. For instance, a Flight record might have fields \u2018DepartureAirport\u2019 and \u2018ArrivalAirport\u2019, each of which is a Reference to the table Airports . When you select an airport in a table, you can have a choice whether to show all flights departing from this airport or all flights arriving to it. The \u201cSelect By\u201d widget will show both options to choose from: Linking summary tables # When widgets display summarized data, as described in Summary tables , they can also be linked, both to the underlying data and to other summary tables. For example, you can summarize the table Employees by job position, and include the count of employees for each position, the average salary, or other summary data. You can also link the Employees table to it, so that selecting a position shows all employees in that position. Furthermore, you can link another summary table. For instance, you can summarize employees by position and gender, and link that to the summary by position. When selecting a job position, you can then see a summary by gender for that position. This is also convenient with charts. In this example, you see a pie chart with the average salary for men vs women for the selected job position. As you click different positions, the pie chart updates to reflect the selected one. More examples of such linking can be found in the Analyze and visualize tutorial. Changing link settings # After a widget is added, you can view and change its link settings from the right panel. One way to get to it is to click on the three-dots icon on the top right of the widget, and click on the \u201cData selection\u201d menu option: This opens the side panel, which shows what data is shown, and which widget, if any, serves as its selector.

In the widget picker, if you select data from Departments , you\u2019ll see a \u201cSelect By\u201d option \u201cEMPLOYEES \u2022 Department\u201d: When you select an employee, you\u2019ll see the details of that employee\u2019s department.","title":"Indirect linking"},{"location":"linking-widgets/#multiple-reference-columns","text":"When a table that\u2019s the target of linking has multiple reference columns, you may need to choose which one to use for linking. For instance, a Flight record might have fields \u2018DepartureAirport\u2019 and \u2018ArrivalAirport\u2019, each of which is a Reference to the table Airports . When you select an airport in a table, you can have a choice whether to show all flights departing from this airport or all flights arriving to it.

For example, you can summarize the table Employees by job position, and include the count of employees for each position, the average salary, or other summary data. You can also link the Employees table to it, so that selecting a position shows all employees in that position. Furthermore, you can link another summary table. For instance, you can summarize employees by position and gender, and link that to the summary by position. When selecting a job position, you can then see a summary by gender for that position. This is also convenient with charts. In this example, you see a pie chart with the average salary for men vs women for the selected job position. As you click different positions, the pie chart updates to reflect the selected one. More examples of such linking can be found in the Analyze and visualize tutorial.","title":"Linking summary tables"},{"location":"linking-widgets/#changing-link-settings","text":"After a widget is added, you can view and change its link settings from the right panel.

The entirety of Python\u2019s standard library is available to you. For those with a spreadsheet background, we\u2019ve also added a suite of Excel-like functions, with all-uppercase names. Here\u2019s the full list of functions . Python formulas are evaluated in a sandbox, without internet access, and without a persistent filesystem. Supported Python versions # We currently support two versions of Python: Python 3 (specifically 3.9 at the time of writing) Python 2 (specifically 2.7) Newly created documents on our hosted service use Python 3 by default, while older documents (created before November 2021 approximately) use Python 2 by default. To tell which version of Python a specific document uses, look at its Document Settings . The Engine setting may be python2 , python3 , or blank. A blank setting implies python2 . If you have editing rights on a document, you can change the Engine setting, and the document will then reload with all formulas now interpreted using the version of Python you have specified. We recommend caution in doing so. A formula that works as intended in one version of Python may give errors in another, or (worse) give the wrong results. Some formulas may fail or give wrong results if used with a version of Python that is different from the one for which they were written. Python 2 reached its end of life in January 2020, so if you look online for python help, the answers you find are more and more likely to be for Python 3. If you have a document that uses Python 2, and you\u2019d like to switch it to use Python 3, we recommend reading Testing the effect of changing Python versions and Differences between Python versions . Be sure to check all tables and columns, and both regular formalas and trigger formulas. We\u2019d be interested to hear your experience, and to help with any problems, on the community forum . Self-hosted Grist may use any version of Python you configure it with, but bear in mind we actively test only the supported versions. Testing the effect of changing Python versions # Grist has some features that can help you evaluate the consequences of changing the Python version a document uses. The Work on a Copy feature is useful to experiment with changing the Python version without affecting your document until you are ready. There is a \u201cCompare with original\u201d option that will let you visualize which cells changed, if any. Be sure to look at all tables and columns. The Activity tab of Document History (with \u201cAll Tables\u201d selected) lets you review in more detail what has changed. Be careful to test any trigger formulas you may have, since the Python code in them won\u2019t be exercised until you specifically trigger these formulas. You can use the code viewer to quickly remind yourself of all formulas in a document, so you can systematically check them all. Differences between Python versions # There are important differences between Python 2 and 3. Formulas may need to be changed in order to give the same results when switching between Python versions. There are many online resources such as this compatibility cheatsheet which can help figure out what the issue is when you hit a difference, and get ideas on how to resolve it. Here, we list common cases we\u2019ve seen in Grist formulas. Division of whole numbers # In Python 2, dividing whole numbers gives a whole number, so 9 / 2 is 4 . In Python 3, it is 4.5 . For a spreadsheet, this is a much more sensible answer, but if you rely on the Python 2 behavior, we suggest you switch to the // operator which is consistent between versions ( 9 // 2 is 4 for both). For example the General Ledger template had a Python 2 formula for computing the quarter from a date (so a Date of 2021-08-15 gave a Quarter of 2021 Q3 ) as follows: \"%s Q%s\" % ($Date.year, CEILING($Date.month, 3) / 3) when switching to Python 3, this needed correcting to: \"%s Q%s\" % ($Date.year, CEILING($Date.month, 3) // 3) Otherwise Quarters became fractional! Some imports are reorganized # Python has a useful standard library, but some parts of it were moved around between Python 2 and 3. For example, several of our templates have formulas to construct URLs, to open custom searches for example, or to open a pre-populated email with calculated To , CC , and Subject values. Python has handy helpers for constructing URLs, but they moved around a bit between Python versions. Our Lightweight CRM example had a Python 2 formula like this to kick off a search for emails in Gmail: from urllib import quote_plus \"Gmail search https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/%s\" % quote_plus($Email) In Python 3, the import line needed changing to: from urllib.parse import quote_plus Subtle change in rounding # Python 3 switches the built-in function round() from rounding the way many people learned in school (where when rounding .5 , you always round up) to what is called \u201cbanker\u2019s rounding\u201d (where you round from .5 to the nearest even number).

To tell which version of Python a specific document uses, look at its Document Settings . The Engine setting may be python2 , python3 , or blank. A blank setting implies python2 . If you have editing rights on a document, you can change the Engine setting, and the document will then reload with all formulas now interpreted using the version of Python you have specified. We recommend caution in doing so. A formula that works as intended in one version of Python may give errors in another, or (worse) give the wrong results. Some formulas may fail or give wrong results if used with a version of Python that is different from the one for which they were written. Python 2 reached its end of life in January 2020, so if you look online for python help, the answers you find are more and more likely to be for Python 3.

Searching # At the top of the document screen, you\u2019ll see a magnifying glass icon ( ) which opens a spreadsheet-like search. You can also start searching using the keyboard shortcut \u2318 F (Mac) or Ctrl + F (Windows). As you type into the search textbox, Grist will move the cursor to the next cell containing your search text. If there are no more matches in the current widget or page, the cursor will move to the next widget or switch to the next page. Sorting # It\u2019s easy to find a word in a dictionary, but it wouldn\u2019t be if the words weren\u2019t sorted! Grist offers flexible and convenient sorting options, which are quite different from a traditional spreadsheet. To sort a table in Grist by a column, open the menu from the column\u2019s header and select \u201cSort\u201d: In the same menu item, you can choose to sort in ascending or descending order. Difference from Excel : Importantly, sorting does not change any formula calculations, it only changes the order in which you see the records. This is different from spreadsheets like Excel. Another difference is that the sort setting is \u201cactive\u201d: if you add a record, or change a cell that\u2019s used for sorting, the record will jump into its correct position in the sort order. See Saving Row Positions below for an option more similar to Excel\u2019s behavior. Multiple Columns # When a table is sorted, you can click another column to add it to the sort: The second column determines the order of records whose values in the first column are the same. You can add more columns to the sort. For example, you could: Sort employees first by Department, then by Last Name, then by First Name. Sort transactions first by Date, then by Amount. Sort tasks first by \u2018Is Completed\u2019 column, then by Priority. Saving Sort Settings # Because sorting only affects your view of data, you can sort data in a Grist document even if you do not have edit access to it. If you can write to a document, then you can also save sort settings. When you change sorting on a table, the icon on top of it gets highlighted in green. Click it to see the currently active setting, as well as the options to manipulate them (e.g. remove a column from the sort), to save the setting, or to revert your changes: When you save sort settings, they will apply to the widget any time this page is opened, either by you or other collaborators. Multiple Views : Just like you can create multiple pages showing data from the same table, you can have different sort settings on each view of the data. E.g. you could have one view showing credit card transactions sorted by date, and another showing them sorted by amount. Sorting from Side Panel # You can sort widgets other than Table, such as Card List or Chart, using the \u201cSort & Filter\u201d subtab in the side panel: You can add one or more columns, save or revert settings and use advanced sorting options. Advance sorting options # The \u201cSort & Filter\u201d subtab exposes additional sorting options that might be useful for various column types: Use choice position \u2013 available on Choice column, sorts records using the configured order of choice items, rather then their names. Empty values last \u2013 in alphabetical order empty values are shown first by default, use this option to put them at the end. Natural sort \u2013 for Text column will treat multi-digit numbers in strings as if they were a single character, allowing more human-friendly ordering. For example, using natural sort , Product10 will be positioned after Product2 . Saving Row Positions # When you use the side panel, you\u2019ll notice one extra button: \u201cUpdate Data\u201d. If you click it, the current position of the records relative to each other is saved, and the active sort by your selected columns is turned off. In other words, rows will no longer jump into place according to values in certain columns, but will remain in the place they are in. You will also be able to reorder rows manually by dragging them. Filtering # You can choose to see only a subset of data in a table by filtering for certain values in a column. Open the column menu from any column\u2019s header, and click \u201cFilter Data\u201d. You\u2019ll see a dialog listing the values in the column: Uncheck the values you don\u2019t want to see, or click \u201cSelect none\u201d and then check only the values you do want to see. The magnifying glass icon in the corner of the dialog lets you find values of interest if the list is long. Click \u201cApply\u201d to apply your setting. You can filter by more than one column. Only those rows will appear which match all of the filters. As with sorting, you can save filters to the view. Click the highlighted \u201cSort & Filter\u201d icon on top of the table: You\u2019ll see the columns for which there are active filters, and options to save the filter, or to revert to saved settings.

When you select this button, a list of your columns will appear. Filtering from the filter bar works exactly like the filtering described above. Note that there is a search bar at the top that allows you to easily find values in longer lists. Click \u201cApply\u201d to apply your settings. If you want to save your filters for future sessions, click the green checkmark next to the \u201cSearch & Filter\u201d icon to save. The value in not saving settings is the ability to do quick filters and lookups without saving that filter forever, or for the rest of your team to see. So it may be useful to save the buttons without any filtering to create a quick filter toolbar. If you do save settings with filters applied, that saves it for future sessions and other team members will see the same thing. With the Filter Bar on, you have buttons that you can use to more easily see and update your filters.

They are similar to \u201cpivot tables\u201d in spreadsheets, and to GROUP BY clauses in databases. They let you get table-wide totals or any subtotals. Summary tables have many uses: Group projects by status, or by priority. Summarize bank transactions by year, or quarter, or by category. Group employees by position, or gender, or department. Summarize by any combination, such as position and gender and department. Group all records to calculate table-wide totals and statistics. Adding summaries # Click \u201cAdd New\u201d button and select \u201cAdd Page\u201d or \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In the widget picker, click the summation icon ( ) next to the table you\u2019d like to summarize. When creating a summary table, you choose a field or a combination of fields by which data should be grouped. These are called the \u201cGroup by\u201d fields. The summary table will contain one row for each group-by value. For instance, if \u201cPosition\u201d is selected as a group-by field, the summary table will contain one row for each job position. Grist\u2019s powerful formulas then allow arbitrary calculations on the matching subsets of the underlying data. Keep in mind that the group-by fields determine which groups should exist in the summary table. Do not select values you\u2019d like to calculate (e.g. for average salary) as group-by fields; these will be created using formulas in the next step. Tip: You can think of rows in a summary table as buckets into which your records will be placed. Group-by fields determine the labels for these buckets. For instance, a summary of projects grouped by status (e.g. \u201cActive\u201d, \u201cCompleted\u201d, \u201cNotStarted\u201d) will have three such buckets, one for each status. Every project goes into one of these three buckets. You can then easily calculate info for each folder, such as a count of projects or the total of their costs. Summary formulas # When you add a summary table, each of the selected group-by fields becomes a column in the new table. Everything else in the summary table is calculated using formula columns. Some of these columns are created automatically, as a convenience. Specifically, a column count will be added to show the number of records in the group represented by the current summary row. And for any numerical column in the original data, the summary table will contain a same-named column with the total. For instance, the summary of Employees grouped by Position would look like this: Tip: A summary widget will have a header like \u201cEMPLOYEES [by Position]\u201d, to indicate that it\u2019s showing summary data for the Employees table, grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d. You can click the title to rename it. If you select a cell in a column like count or AnnualPay and hit Enter , you\u2019ll see the formulas that calculate them: count is len($group) AnnualPay is SUM($group.AnnualPay) The mysterious $group is simply another column, hidden by default (but you may unhide it). It contains for each cell the group of records represented by this summary row. Side note for Python fans. $group is a special Python object. It\u2019s an iterable collection of records. Using an attribute like $group.A is a shorthand for the list of values in the A column of all the records in the group, similar to [r.A for r in $group] . If you unhide this column, it will show as a python list of numeric row IDs which identify the records in the group. Sometimes the automatically created columns don\u2019t make sense. For instance, the sum of PayRate isn\u2019t very meaningful. Simply delete such columns, either using the column menu or using the Alt + Minus keyboard shortcut. You are free to change formulas for the automatically created columns, or to add new formula columns. Note that summary tables do not allow adding non -formula columns. For instance, you might want to change the formula for PayRate from SUM($group.PayRate) to AVERAGE($group.PayRate) , which would be a more interesting value. Here are some useful recipies of formulas in summary tables: Average : AVERAGE($group.PayRate) or SUM($group.PayRate) / $count Standard deviation : STDEV($group.PayRate) Maximum or minimum : MAX($group.PayRate) , MIN($group.PayRate) Sum over a subset of records : SUM(r.AnnualPay for r in $group if r.EmploymentStatus == \"Active\") Weighted average : AVERAGE_WEIGHTED(zip($group.Life_Expectancy, $group.Population)) In fact, you may use the full power of Python to calculate what you\u2019d like. As for any table, your formula may refer to any of the columns in the summary table, not only $group . Changing summary columns # The group-by columns in a summary table are created when you add the widget. It\u2019s not possible to modify the values in them, or to modify their settings, such as type. The settings and values of the group-by columns reflect those in the underlying table. When new values appear in the underlying table for the group-by columns, the summary tables will also get new rows automatically. What you may change is which columns the table is grouped by. Click the three dots on the top right of the summary table, and click \u201cData selection\u201d: The settings in the side pane tell you which data is shown and how it\u2019s grouped: You can click \u201cEdit Data Selection\u201d button to open the same widget picker that you used to add the summary table. You can now deselect some \u201cGroup by\u201d fields and select others, and click \u201cSave\u201d to update the summary table. Linking summary tables # You can link summary tables to other widgets. If you have a summary table on a page, it can be used as a selector for a table of underlying data, or for a more detailed summary. For example, if you have a summary of Employees by \u201cPosition\u201d, it will be available as a \u201cSELECT BY\u201d option when adding an unsummarized table of Employees : The result is that you can select a position in the summary table, and see all employees in that position. You could similarly link a summary of Employees grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d and \u201cGender\u201d to the first widget: You can then select a position in the \u201cEmployees [by Position]\u201d widget, and see a breakdown by gender among the employees in that position. Note that such linking requires the new widget to include both \u201cPosition\u201d and \u201cGender\u201d in its group-by columns. For more about linking, see Linking widgets . Charting summarized data # Summary tables are a great source of data for charts, including dynamic charts. In the example above, we could add another widget showing Employees grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d and \u201cGender\u201d, but this time in a Chart widget. Select \u201cBar Chart\u201d for the chart type, and select \u201cGender\u201d and \u201cAnnualPay\u201d as Visible Series. You can now click on a position, and see visually the gender difference in average salary for this position. The Analyze and visualize tutorial shows other examples of charts based on summary tables. Detaching summary tables # Summary tables are computed from underlying data. Sometimes, however, its useful to \u201cdetach\u201d a summary table and turn it into an independent data table. For example, we\u2019ve seen how to summarize a table of Employees , grouping it by the column \u201cPosition\u201d. Let\u2019s say you want to associate some data with each position, such as a job description, or a workers compensation insurance code. Such data belongs in its own table, with one row for each position, and a few columns. Summary tables provide an easy way to create such a table. Add a page with a summary of Employees grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d. Now, in the right panel\u2019s \u201cData\u201d tab, click the \u201cDetach\u201d button. Your summary table just got turned into a brand new table with the same rows and an auto-generated name, like \u201cTable1\u201d. You can rename it to \u201cPositions\u201d, and add the columns you need: The calculated columns remain. In fact, anything you could calculate about each position in the \u201cEmployees [by Position]\u201d summary table, you may still calculate in the new \u201cPositions\u201d table. One difference is that new values will not get added to the detached table automatically. In other words, if a never-before-seen position (perhaps \u201cChief Troublemaker\u201d) appears in the underlying data, a summary table would update automatically to include it, but a detached table will not.","title":"Summary tables"},{"location":"summary-tables/#summary-tables","text":"Summary tables are the workhorse of data analysis in Grist.

Additional series create additional bars at each data point and specify their heights. Line Chart # Needs two or more series: the first series is for the X values, the second is for Y values to create the line. Additional series specify Y values for additional lines. Pie Chart # Needs two series: the first for the pie slice labels, the second for the pie slice sizes. Area Chart # Similar to a line chart, needs two or more series: the first for the X values, the second for the Y values to create the line. Additional series specify Y values for additional lines. Scatter Plot # Needs three or more series: the first for the point labels, and the second and third for the X and Y values for each point, respectively. Additional series specify Y values for additional sets of points. Kaplan-Meier Plot # The Kaplan-Meier Plot is useful for certain studies, and needs two series: the first for the label of the line to which a point belongs, the second giving a survival time or time-to-failure of that point.

We won\u2019t make such changes lightly. The Custom widget allows a user to insert almost anything in their document. To create a custom widget currently requires knowledge of web development, and access to a public web server (for example, GitHub Pages). A good use for custom widgets is to view records or tables in new ways. Using Grist as your data model and modern HTML/CSS/JS as your view is very powerful. Minimal example # To demonstrate to a web developer how custom widgets work, there is a minimal working example at: https://public.getgrist.com/911KcgKA95oQ/Minimal-Custom-Widget/m/fork The example shows a table with some random data (names for pets), and two custom widgets, one showing the selected row in the table as JSON, and the other showing all rows of the table as JSON. If you change data in the table, or move the cursor, the custom widgets update as appropriate. The source code for the widgets is at: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget/tree/master/inspect It is stripped down to the essentials. Here is the full source code of the onRecord widget that shows one row of data: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <title>onRecord</title> <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> </head> <body> <pre id=\"readout\">Waiting for data...</pre> <script> grist.ready(); grist.onRecord(function(record) { document.getElementById('readout').innerHTML = JSON.stringify(record, null, 2); }); </script> </body> </html> The \u201cGrist\u201d parts of this are: Including https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js to get the Grist API. Calling grist.ready to let Grist know the widget is ready to go. Calling grist.onRecord to subscribe to the current row of the table. After that, everything else is regular HTML/CSS/JS. Once you have data coming in, you can render it any way you like, using React, Vue.js, or your favorite framework. For example, you could render records as a printable invoice , or use some obscure chart format that Grist doesn\u2019t currently support. Adding a custom widget # To add a custom widget that reads from a table, click on Add New , then Add Widget to Page . Then: For Select Widget choose Custom to get a Custom Widget. For Select Data choose the table you want the widget to read data from. Optionally, choose Select By to control the selected data further (read Linking Page Widgets for the possibilities). The custom widget is initially blank. To configure it, click the three-dots button on the top right of the custom widget, and select \u201cWidget options\u201d. In the CUSTOM settings section where it says Enter Custom URL , put the link to your custom widget. Here is a test widget to simply show table data in JSON: https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/inspect/onRecords.html And here\u2019s one to show the selected row only (make sure \u201cSelect By\u201d is set for the custom widget): https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/inspect/onRecord.html Access level # When you put a link to a custom webpage it will be immediately rendered inside the section. Now you have the option to grant that webpage access to data in your document. The following access levels are available: No document access : the webpage is shown in the widget, but it has no access to the Grist document containing the widget. Read selected table : the webpage is shown in the widget, and is given read access to the table the widget is configured to select data from. Full document access : the webpage is shown in the widget, and has full access to read and modify the Grist document containing the widget. The webpage should be owned and controlled by you or someone you trust. With Read selected table permissions, a widget could send the data it accesses to a third party. With Full document access permissions, a widget could send all the document data to a third party, and modify your document in any way. We do not recommend using Full document access permissions at this time, since the API for modifying the document is not yet stabilized. If you have an urgent need, however, do contact us and request early access. If you are writing your own custom widget you can specify what access level it needs as part of the initial ready message. Possible values are: none , read table and full . <script> grist.ready({ requiredAccess: 'read table' }); </script> This directs Grist to request the desired access level from the user. Your widget will be reloaded with the appropriate access level if the user approves the request. If you wish to get notified of the access level, you can subscribe to the onOptions event that is sent to the widget after it tells Grist it is ready: grist.onOptions(function(options, interaction) { console.log(interaction.access_level); }); For now, just skip the options parameter (it will be described in Widget options section). The current access level is part of the second parameter, which describes how Grist will interact with your widget. Invoice example # The minimal example above showed records as plain JSON, but the widget can get as fancy as you like. Here is an example of showing a record as a printable invoice: You can read the details of how to use this widget in our Invoice preparation example . The invoice widget is hosted at: https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/invoices/ And the source HTML/CSS/JS can be browsed at: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget/tree/master/invoices It uses Vue.js and grist.onRecord . Creating a custom widget # As you saw, writing a simple widget that uses data from a table is very easy. First, you need to tell Grist that you are ready and then subscribe to one of the available events: onRecord , onRecords or onOptions . grist.ready(); grist.onRecord(function (record) { // Cursor has moved. }); grist.onRecords(function (record) { // Data in the table has changed. }); grist.onOptions(function (options, interaction) { // Configuration has changed. }); Let\u2019s say you want to build a custom widget that will show an image from a URL and optionally a single line of text below as the image title. You will need to read two values from two columns: Link and Title . You could access those columns directly using literal column names in your script. Here is a complete example of widget source code that will do the job: <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> <img id=\"image\" src=\"\"/> <div id=\"title\"></div> <script> grist.ready({requiredAccess: 'read table'}); grist.onRecord(function (record) { document.getElementById('image').src = record.Link; document.getElementById('title').innerText = record.Title; }); </script> When getting started, this is a good approach, but it has two significant drawbacks. Every time you rename a column, you will also have to change your widget\u2019s source. Moreover, using this widget on a different table or sharing it with your friends can be difficult as column names might be different. To help with this, Grist offers the column mapping API. Column mapping # Instead of using column names directly, you can ask the user to pick which column to use as a Link and Title . The list of expected columns can be sent to Grist as part of the ready call: grist.ready({columns: ['Link', 'Title']}); Using this information, in the creator panel, Grist will hide the regular \u201cVisible\u201d columns section and display specialized column pickers. Your widget will receive this mapping configuration as part of onRecord or onRecords event in the second parameter. You can use this configuration to do the mappings yourself or use the mapColumnNames helper function to do it for you. <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> <img id=\"image\" src=\"\"/> <div id=\"title\"></div> <script> grist.ready({columns: ['Link', 'Title'], requiredAccess: 'read table'}); grist.onRecord(function (record, mappings) { const mapped = grist.mapColumnNames(record); // First check if all columns were mapped. if (mapped) { document.getElementById('image').src = mapped.Link; document.getElementById('title').innerText = mapped.Title; console.log(`Using ${mappings.Link} and ${mappings.Title} columns`); } else { // Helper returned a null value. It means that not all // required columns were mapped. console.error(\"Please map all columns\"); } }); </script> Now, if you rename one of the columns, the widget will still work. You can also use this widget in any other table or share with a friend, as it doesn\u2019t depend on your table structure and can be easily configured. In the configuration used above, we told Grist that all the columns are required, and the user can pick any column even if the column doesn\u2019t contain a text value. To be more precise, we can include more options in the request. For example: grist.ready({columns: [ { name: \"Link\", // What field we will read. title: \"Image link\", // Friendly field name. optional: false, // Is this an optional field. type: \"Text\" // What type of column we expect. } ]}); The optional setting is important for correct operation of the mapColumnNames helper. This helper will return a mapped record only when all required (not optional) columns are picked. By default Grist will allow the user to pick any type of column. To allow only a column of a specific type, you need to set a type property. Here are all valid types: Any , Int ( Integer column ), Numeric ( Numeric column ), Text , Date , DateTime , Bool ( Toggle column ), Choice , ChoiceList , Ref ( Reference column ), RefList ( Reference List ), Attachments . Suppose the user deletes a column or changes its type so that it will no longer match the type requested by the widget. In that case, Grist will automatically remove this column from the mapping. Widget options # If your widget needs to store some options, Grist offers a simple key-value storage API for you to use. Here are some JavaScript code snippets that show how to interact with this API: // Store a simple text value . await grist.setOption('color', '#FF0000'); // Store complex objects as JSON. await grist.setOption('settings', {lines: 10, skipFirst: true}); // Read previously saved option const color = await grist.getOption('color'); // Clear all options. await grist.clearOptions(); // Get and replace all options. await grist.getOptions(); await grist.setOptions({...}); You can experiment with this yourself. Here is a test widget that demonstrates how to use this API: https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/inspect/onOptions.html When your widget saves or edits some options, the icon on top of the section gets highlighted in green. You can either apply those options to the widget or revert that modification. This allows viewers (users with read-only access) or collaborators to configure your widget without overwriting original settings.

Saving current options you will apply them to the widget and make them available to others. Using this menu, you can also clear all options to revert the widget to its initial state. To do this, press the little trash icon and then Save . Grist will also trigger an event, every time the options are changed (or cleared).

A better pattern is to apply them all when they are changed. Using the onOptions handler will make your widget easier to change and understand later. There is one more scenario to cover. Suppose your widget has some kind of custom configuration screen. In that case, you probably need some button or other UI element that the user can use to show it. This additional UI element will likely be rarely used by you or your collaborators, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to show it all the time. To help with this, Grist offers an additional interaction option you can send as part of the ready message: grist.ready({ onEditOptions: function() { // Your custom logic to open the custom configuration screen. } }); This will tell Grist to display an additional button Open configuration in the creator panel and the section menu. When clicked, it will trigger your handler, which you can use to show your own custom configuration screen.","title":"Custom"},{"location":"widget-custom/#page-widget-custom","text":"Custom widgets are an experimental feature The design of custom widgets is likely to evolve, and sometimes that will require updates to documents that use them. We won\u2019t make such changes lightly. The Custom widget allows a user to insert almost anything in their document. To create a custom widget currently requires knowledge of web development, and access to a public web server (for example, GitHub Pages). A good use for custom widgets is to view records or tables in new ways. Using Grist as your data model and modern HTML/CSS/JS as your view is very powerful.","title":"Page widget: Custom"},{"location":"widget-custom/#minimal-example","text":"To demonstrate to a web developer how custom widgets work, there is a minimal working example at: https://public.getgrist.com/911KcgKA95oQ/Minimal-Custom-Widget/m/fork The example shows a table with some random data (names for pets), and two custom widgets, one showing the selected row in the table as JSON, and the other showing all rows of the table as JSON. If you change data in the table, or move the cursor, the custom widgets update as appropriate. The source code for the widgets is at: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget/tree/master/inspect It is stripped down to the essentials. Here is the full source code of the onRecord widget that shows one row of data: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <title>onRecord</title> <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> </head> <body> <pre id=\"readout\">Waiting for data...</pre> <script> grist.ready(); grist.onRecord(function(record) { document.getElementById('readout').innerHTML = JSON.stringify(record, null, 2); }); </script> </body> </html> The \u201cGrist\u201d parts of this are: Including https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js to get the Grist API. Calling grist.ready to let Grist know the widget is ready to go. Calling grist.onRecord to subscribe to the current row of the table. After that, everything else is regular HTML/CSS/JS. Once you have data coming in, you can render it any way you like, using React, Vue.js, or your favorite framework.

The following access levels are available: No document access : the webpage is shown in the widget, but it has no access to the Grist document containing the widget. Read selected table : the webpage is shown in the widget, and is given read access to the table the widget is configured to select data from. Full document access : the webpage is shown in the widget, and has full access to read and modify the Grist document containing the widget. The webpage should be owned and controlled by you or someone you trust. With Read selected table permissions, a widget could send the data it accesses to a third party. With Full document access permissions, a widget could send all the document data to a third party, and modify your document in any way. We do not recommend using Full document access permissions at this time, since the API for modifying the document is not yet stabilized. If you have an urgent need, however, do contact us and request early access. If you are writing your own custom widget you can specify what access level it needs as part of the initial ready message. Possible values are: none , read table and full . <script> grist.ready({ requiredAccess: 'read table' }); </script> This directs Grist to request the desired access level from the user. Your widget will be reloaded with the appropriate access level if the user approves the request. If you wish to get notified of the access level, you can subscribe to the onOptions event that is sent to the widget after it tells Grist it is ready: grist.onOptions(function(options, interaction) { console.log(interaction.access_level); }); For now, just skip the options parameter (it will be described in Widget options section).

First, you need to tell Grist that you are ready and then subscribe to one of the available events: onRecord , onRecords or onOptions . grist.ready(); grist.onRecord(function (record) { // Cursor has moved. }); grist.onRecords(function (record) { // Data in the table has changed. }); grist.onOptions(function (options, interaction) { // Configuration has changed. }); Let\u2019s say you want to build a custom widget that will show an image from a URL and optionally a single line of text below as the image title. You will need to read two values from two columns: Link and Title . You could access those columns directly using literal column names in your script. Here is a complete example of widget source code that will do the job: <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> <img id=\"image\" src=\"\"/> <div id=\"title\"></div> <script> grist.ready({requiredAccess: 'read table'}); grist.onRecord(function (record) { document.getElementById('image').src = record.Link; document.getElementById('title').innerText = record.Title; }); </script> When getting started, this is a good approach, but it has two significant drawbacks. Every time you rename a column, you will also have to change your widget\u2019s source. Moreover, using this widget on a different table or sharing it with your friends can be difficult as column names might be different. To help with this, Grist offers the column mapping API.","title":"Creating a custom widget"},{"location":"widget-custom/#column-mapping","text":"Instead of using column names directly, you can ask the user to pick which column to use as a Link and Title . The list of expected columns can be sent to Grist as part of the ready call: grist.ready({columns: ['Link', 'Title']}); Using this information, in the creator panel, Grist will hide the regular \u201cVisible\u201d columns section and display specialized column pickers. Your widget will receive this mapping configuration as part of onRecord or onRecords event in the second parameter. You can use this configuration to do the mappings yourself or use the mapColumnNames helper function to do it for you. <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> <img id=\"image\" src=\"\"/> <div id=\"title\"></div> <script> grist.ready({columns: ['Link', 'Title'], requiredAccess: 'read table'}); grist.onRecord(function (record, mappings) { const mapped = grist.mapColumnNames(record); // First check if all columns were mapped. if (mapped) { document.getElementById('image').src = mapped.Link; document.getElementById('title').innerText = mapped.Title; console.log(`Using ${mappings.Link} and ${mappings.Title} columns`); } else { // Helper returned a null value. It means that not all // required columns were mapped. console.error(\"Please map all columns\"); } }); </script> Now, if you rename one of the columns, the widget will still work. You can also use this widget in any other table or share with a friend, as it doesn\u2019t depend on your table structure and can be easily configured. In the configuration used above, we told Grist that all the columns are required, and the user can pick any column even if the column doesn\u2019t contain a text value. To be more precise, we can include more options in the request. For example: grist.ready({columns: [ { name: \"Link\", // What field we will read. title: \"Image link\", // Friendly field name. optional: false, // Is this an optional field. type: \"Text\" // What type of column we expect. } ]}); The optional setting is important for correct operation of the mapColumnNames helper. This helper will return a mapped record only when all required (not optional) columns are picked. By default Grist will allow the user to pick any type of column. To allow only a column of a specific type, you need to set a type property. Here are all valid types: Any , Int ( Integer column ), Numeric ( Numeric column ), Text , Date , DateTime , Bool ( Toggle column ), Choice , ChoiceList , Ref ( Reference column ), RefList ( Reference List ), Attachments . Suppose the user deletes a column or changes its type so that it will no longer match the type requested by the widget. In that case, Grist will automatically remove this column from the mapping.","title":"Column mapping"},{"location":"widget-custom/#widget-options","text":"If your widget needs to store some options, Grist offers a simple key-value storage API for you to use.

To organize a book club is pretty simple. The club will work best if everyone actually gets the book, and has opinions for what to read next time. Grist can help with all that. To nudge the book into everyone\u2019s hands, it helps to have links to borrow the book at your local library, and to buy the book from your local (or not-so-local) store. And for ideas about what to read next time, it helps to be able to easily suggest books, and to learn about books others suggest via sites like GoodReads, Wikipedia, and Amazon. Suppose we start with a simple table of books, with book titles and author names. To borrow or buy the book, it is best to have its unique ISBN code, so there\u2019s no ambiguity or mix-ups. One thing we can do is add a link to search for a book on isbnsearch.org by its title and author. To do this, add a new column, and then set it to be a HyperLink column : What we\u2019re going to do is fill this column using a formula that takes the book title and the author\u2019s name, and uses them as a keyword to search on the isbnsearch.org site. Here\u2019s the formula: import urllib keywords = ($Title or \"\") + \" \" + ($Author or \"\") \"[isbn] https://isbnsearch.org/search?s=\" + urllib.quote(keywords) URLs with spaces or apostrophes or other odd letters you might find in names need special encoding, so we\u2019ve used the python urllib module to make sure everything gets encoded correctly. Now we\u2019ve got a handy [isbn] link beside each book: We can click the arrow by [isbn] , locate the book, and make note of its ISBN code in a new column: Then we can add it into our book list. Now that we have a helping hand for finding ISBNs, let\u2019s add a few more books too: Library and store lookups # Once we have the ISBN, adding a link to buy the book is easy. Here\u2019s a formula for the indiebound.org site, which in the U.S. is likely to have an independent book store near you as a member: \"[buy] https://indiebound.org/book/\" + $ISBN If you don\u2019t have a local bookstore, there\u2019s Amazon, or pretty much any site you like (just find a search page on their site, and match the pattern). import urllib keywords = ($Title or \"\") + \" \" + ($Author or \"\") + \" \" + ($ISBN or \"\") \"[amazon] https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&k=\" + urllib.quote($keywords) The new links look like this: Clicking on the [buy] link near a book now brings us to that book on indiebound.org . For your local library, the same idea is very likely to work.

To organize a book club is pretty simple. The club will work best if everyone actually gets the book, and has opinions for what to read next time. Grist can help with all that. To nudge the book into everyone\u2019s hands, it helps to have links to borrow the book at your local library, and to buy the book from your local (or not-so-local) store. And for ideas about what to read next time, it helps to be able to easily suggest books, and to learn about books others suggest via sites like GoodReads, Wikipedia, and Amazon. Suppose we start with a simple table of books, with book titles and author names. To borrow or buy the book, it is best to have its unique ISBN code, so there\u2019s no ambiguity or mix-ups. One thing we can do is add a link to search for a book on isbnsearch.org by its title and author. To do this, add a new column, and then set it to be a HyperLink column : What we\u2019re going to do is fill this column using a formula that takes the book title and the author\u2019s name, and uses them as a keyword to search on the isbnsearch.org site. Here\u2019s the formula: import urllib keywords = ($Title or \"\") + \" \" + ($Author or \"\") \"[isbn] https://isbnsearch.org/search?s=\" + urllib.quote(keywords) URLs with spaces or apostrophes or other odd letters you might find in names need special encoding, so we\u2019ve used the python urllib module to make sure everything gets encoded correctly. Now we\u2019ve got a handy [isbn] link beside each book: We can click the arrow by [isbn] , locate the book, and make note of its ISBN code in a new column: Then we can add it into our book list. Now that we have a helping hand for finding ISBNs, let\u2019s add a few more books too:","title":"Book Lists with Library and Store Look-ups"},{"location":"examples/2020-06-book-club/#library-and-store-lookups","text":"Once we have the ISBN, adding a link to buy the book is easy.

This tutorial shows you how to set up a document like this: You can find a finished template at https://templates.getgrist.com/9NH6D58FmxwP/Invoicing . If you\u2019d like to add invoices to an existing document, making them work the way you want, understanding this tutorial should get you there. Setting up an invoice table # First of all, make a table to record invoices by creating an empty document and renaming Table1 to Invoices : Now, let\u2019s add a widget beside the table to view the finished invoices. There are all sorts of possible styles of invoice, so Grist lets web developers create their own using Custom Widgets. We\u2019ll use an example invoice style published by Grist, but if it doesn\u2019t match your needs any web developer could tweak it for you. Click on Add New , then Add Widget to Page . Then: For Select Widget choose Custom since we\u2019ll be using a Custom Widget. For Select Data choose Invoices since we\u2019ll be viewing data from the invoices table. For Select By choose INVOICES so that the Custom Widget will show data from whatever invoice is currently selected by the user. Great, now we have two widgets, a Table Widget that will have invoice data, and a Custom Widget that will view that data as a nicely formatted, printable invoice. The Custom Widget starts off blank; select Widget options to specify what we want in it: In the CUSTOM settings section where it says Full URL of webpage to show , put this link: https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/invoices/ And set Access to read table . This grants the Custom Widget access to read the Invoices table. Now place anything you like in a row of the Invoices table (I just added the number 1 ). An incomplete invoice will immediately show up: The incomplete invoice shows what column names to use to control what parts of the invoice. An extra black box shows what columns the widget understands, what columns it is ignoring, and what extra columns the widget could make use of. Currently it is saying that it doesn\u2019t recognize any of the columns present, is expecting columns like Number , Client , Items , etc., and is ignoring the default A , B , and C columns in the Invoices table. Looking at the start of the invoice we see a space for an invoice number, INVOICE NUMBER: #Number . So let\u2019s rename the A column to Number , we could leave the value as 1, but then it looks like we haven\u2019t done much business yet. I\u2019m going to choose the set the invoice number to be $id + 51371 , where $id is an auto-incrementing numeric identifier assigned to each row. But you could set it manually or with a different formula. As soon as it is set, the invoice updates: The next column the help box suggests is Client , so let\u2019s rename the B column to Client . Later we will give client information in a structured way, but for now let\u2019s just put some text here (use Shift + Enter to insert line breaks): Great, now the Client box is filled out. The next suggested column is Items , so let\u2019s rename the C column to Items . Later we will give item information in a structured way, but for now let\u2019s just put some text here: And now the Description is set. We\u2019re missing a total, so let\u2019s add a column called Total and set it to 100 : The invoice won\u2019t update immediately. This is the first new column we\u2019ve added - until now we\u2019ve been renaming them. When we created the Custom Widget, it was given access to the columns that existed at the time of creation. To let the widget see the new column, open Widget options again and move Total from Hidden Columns to Visible Columns : Great, the invoice updated. Now let\u2019s set who the invoice is from, by adding an Invoicer column (remember to make it visible to the widget via Widget options ). As a last step to creating a usable invoice, let\u2019s make an Issued column and put today\u2019s date in it (remember to make it visible to the widget via Widget options ). As soon as the invoice has a date, the black help box will disappear: Okay! If someone sent me that, I\u2019d pay it. You should nudge me by giving it a due date though. Let\u2019s make a Due column and set it to a month from the Issued date. Remember to make the Due column visible to the widget via Widget options . Also, be sure to set the Column Type for Issued to Date or you won\u2019t be able to do date math on it (it will just be a string). If there are special instructions to go with the invoice, we can add a Note column. Remember to make it visible to the widget via Widget options . Entering client information # Now, let\u2019s make two useful changes to the invoice set-up: Put client information in a separate table, so we don\u2019t have to reenter their address every time we invoice them (and we can import the addresses in bulk). Enter items and prices in a table, so multi-item invoices are easy to make (and we can use formulas and look-ups for pricing if we like). Before doing so, we need to let Grist know that the content of the invoice will depend on these other tables, so that it can update it when something changes, and make sure the invoice gets access to everything it needs. Make a column named References and give it this formula: = RECORD(rec, expand_refs=1) That says \u201ctake the current record, and package it up, including everything it references directly\u201d. Since Grist is a spreadsheet, it also implies \u201cupdate everything that depends on this column if anything in the references changes\u201d. Remember to make the References column visible to the widget via Widget options , so that the widget will get updated as we add and change referenced material. When the invoice widget sees a column named \u201cReferences\u201d, it fills out the invoice using the \u201cpackaged\u201d values in that column, rather than the individual invoice fields. The benefit will be seen in the next step, since these packaged values can include data from related records. Next let\u2019s place client information in a separate table. Add a new table to the page for entering business information by clicking on Add New , Add Widget to Page , then Select Widget > Table and Select Data > New Table : Then rename the table to Businesses . Let\u2019s also empty the Client column so we can see help about what the widget expects there: The widget suggests Name , Street1 , Street2 , City , State and Zip columns. So let\u2019s provide those columns in our Businesses table, and fill them in for an example client. Then place the same Name in the Client column, and in Column options set the Column Type to Reference . Refer to Businesses Name if Grist doesn\u2019t automatically guess that. Once you hit Apply , you will see a nicely formatted Client section. Entering invoicer information # We could do the same thing for the Invoicer column as we did for the Client column, and make it a reference to the Businesses table or a separate table. However, if you will always be using the same name and address for your business, you could skip setting up a reference by entering a formula like this into the Invoicer column (start typing with = to make it a formula): { \"Name\": \"Thunderous Applause\", \"Street1\": \"6502 Automated Rd\", \"City\": \"New York\", \"State\": \"NY\", \"Zip\": \"10003\", \"Email\": \"applause@thunder.com\", \"Phone\": \"+1-800-YAY-YAYS\", \"Website\": \"applause.com\" } Then set the Column Type for Invoicer to Any in the right-side panel. Notice how emails, phone numbers, and links are specially formatted by the widget. Entering item information # Now, let\u2019s set up the list of items and prices that is at the heart of an invoice. Clear the Items column to see what we can put there. It will show that Items can be a list, where each item has a Description , Price , Quantity , and Total . So we go ahead and add an Items table like we added Businesses , and give it those four columns. We can set Total to be this simple formula: $Price * $Quantity Now we need to pull these items into the Invoices table so that the Custom Widget gets access to them. Set the Items column to the formula Items.lookupRecords() , and then reset its column type to be Any . This formula needs a little more work, which we\u2019ll do soon, but let\u2019s just start with that. Great, our invoice is updating nicely! Remove the Total column to get an automatically calculated one: It is probably more comfortable to edit invoices as a Card Widget than a Table Widget, so let\u2019s change that using Widget options , Table , Change Widget , Card , Save . You can customize the card layout to your taste. To add a new invoice, click the little + above the invoices card, set an Issued date, and pick either the existing Client or add a new one. Once we have a second invoice, it becomes clear we skimped on the formula for collecting invoice items - all the invoices contain all the items. No problem, we can get more specific by adding an Invoice column to Items and setting it up to refer to specific Invoices : Once that is done we can sprinkle on some Grist fairy dust, and go to Widget options for the ITEMS Table Widget, click Change Widget , and set SELECT BY to INVOICES Card . Once that is saved, only the items for the currently selected invoice are shown. Even better, when you add new items, the invoice column is automatically set to the invoice you are viewing. So you can just hide the invoice column and forget about it. Now let the Custom Widget know what items to use by updating the Items formula to be more picky: Items.lookupRecords(Invoice=$id) With that, entering new invoices is a breeze! Click + to add a new invoice card. Pick the client, set the issue date. Add items. Done! Final polish # You can adjust the set-up to taste. For example, I would choose to add new clients on a separate page ( B or Businesses on the left panel) since that is relatively infrequent; you could choose to keep that on the same page. I don\u2019t need deductions or taxes, if you do you could add columns and/or formulas for those. The invoice custom widget works for me as is, but if I needed to tweak anything I could copy the GitHub repository it is in and change it a bit (or hire a web developer to do that for me - they don\u2019t need to be Grist experts). For interested developers, the GitHub code is here: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget/tree/master/invoices .

Now let\u2019s set who the invoice is from, by adding an Invoicer column (remember to make it visible to the widget via Widget options ). As a last step to creating a usable invoice, let\u2019s make an Issued column and put today\u2019s date in it (remember to make it visible to the widget via Widget options ). As soon as the invoice has a date, the black help box will disappear: Okay! If someone sent me that, I\u2019d pay it. You should nudge me by giving it a due date though. Let\u2019s make a Due column and set it to a month from the Issued date. Remember to make the Due column visible to the widget via Widget options . Also, be sure to set the Column Type for Issued to Date or you won\u2019t be able to do date math on it (it will just be a string). If there are special instructions to go with the invoice, we can add a Note column. Remember to make it visible to the widget via Widget options .","title":"Setting up an invoice table"},{"location":"examples/2020-08-invoices/#entering-client-information","text":"Now, let\u2019s make two useful changes to the invoice set-up: Put client information in a separate table, so we don\u2019t have to reenter their address every time we invoice them (and we can import the addresses in bulk). Enter items and prices in a table, so multi-item invoices are easy to make (and we can use formulas and look-ups for pricing if we like). Before doing so, we need to let Grist know that the content of the invoice will depend on these other tables, so that it can update it when something changes, and make sure the invoice gets access to everything it needs. Make a column named References and give it this formula: = RECORD(rec, expand_refs=1) That says \u201ctake the current record, and package it up, including everything it references directly\u201d. Since Grist is a spreadsheet, it also implies \u201cupdate everything that depends on this column if anything in the references changes\u201d. Remember to make the References column visible to the widget via Widget options , so that the widget will get updated as we add and change referenced material. When the invoice widget sees a column named \u201cReferences\u201d, it fills out the invoice using the \u201cpackaged\u201d values in that column, rather than the individual invoice fields. The benefit will be seen in the next step, since these packaged values can include data from related records. Next let\u2019s place client information in a separate table. Add a new table to the page for entering business information by clicking on Add New , Add Widget to Page , then Select Widget > Table and Select Data > New Table : Then rename the table to Businesses . Let\u2019s also empty the Client column so we can see help about what the widget expects there: The widget suggests Name , Street1 , Street2 , City , State and Zip columns. So let\u2019s provide those columns in our Businesses table, and fill them in for an example client. Then place the same Name in the Client column, and in Column options set the Column Type to Reference . Refer to Businesses Name if Grist doesn\u2019t automatically guess that. Once you hit Apply , you will see a nicely formatted Client section.","title":"Entering client information"},{"location":"examples/2020-08-invoices/#entering-invoicer-information","text":"We could do the same thing for the Invoicer column as we did for the Client column, and make it a reference to the Businesses table or a separate table. However, if you will always be using the same name and address for your business, you could skip setting up a reference by entering a formula like this into the Invoicer column (start typing with = to make it a formula): { \"Name\": \"Thunderous Applause\", \"Street1\": \"6502 Automated Rd\", \"City\": \"New York\", \"State\": \"NY\", \"Zip\": \"10003\", \"Email\": \"applause@thunder.com\", \"Phone\": \"+1-800-YAY-YAYS\", \"Website\": \"applause.com\" } Then set the Column Type for Invoicer to Any in the right-side panel. Notice how emails, phone numbers, and links are specially formatted by the widget.","title":"Entering invoicer information"},{"location":"examples/2020-08-invoices/#entering-item-information","text":"Now, let\u2019s set up the list of items and prices that is at the heart of an invoice. Clear the Items column to see what we can put there. It will show that Items can be a list, where each item has a Description , Price , Quantity , and Total . So we go ahead and add an Items table like we added Businesses , and give it those four columns. We can set Total to be this simple formula: $Price * $Quantity Now we need to pull these items into the Invoices table so that the Custom Widget gets access to them. Set the Items column to the formula Items.lookupRecords() , and then reset its column type to be Any . This formula needs a little more work, which we\u2019ll do soon, but let\u2019s just start with that. Great, our invoice is updating nicely! Remove the Total column to get an automatically calculated one: It is probably more comfortable to edit invoices as a Card Widget than a Table Widget, so let\u2019s change that using Widget options , Table , Change Widget , Card , Save . You can customize the card layout to your taste. To add a new invoice, click the little + above the invoices card, set an Issued date, and pick either the existing Client or add a new one. Once we have a second invoice, it becomes clear we skimped on the formula for collecting invoice items - all the invoices contain all the items. No problem, we can get more specific by adding an Invoice column to Items and setting it up to refer to specific Invoices : Once that is done we can sprinkle on some Grist fairy dust, and go to Widget options for the ITEMS Table Widget, click Change Widget , and set SELECT BY to INVOICES Card . Once that is saved, only the items for the currently selected invoice are shown. Even better, when you add new items, the invoice column is automatically set to the invoice you are viewing. So you can just hide the invoice column and forget about it. Now let the Custom Widget know what items to use by updating the Items formula to be more picky: Items.lookupRecords(Invoice=$id) With that, entering new invoices is a breeze! Click + to add a new invoice card. Pick the client, set the issue date. Add items. Done!","title":"Entering item information"},{"location":"examples/2020-08-invoices/#final-polish","text":"You can adjust the set-up to taste. For example, I would choose to add new clients on a separate page ( B or Businesses on the left panel) since that is relatively infrequent; you could choose to keep that on the same page. I don\u2019t need deductions or taxes, if you do you could add columns and/or formulas for those. The invoice custom widget works for me as is, but if I needed to tweak anything I could copy the GitHub repository it is in and change it a bit (or hire a web developer to do that for me - they don\u2019t need to be Grist experts).

You may be using a payroll service, and it probably asks you to enter hours for each employee once a month. This is where Grist can help you keep track of things conveniently, and to reduce mistakes, especially if you have part-time employees. The Payroll Template # The finished template is here: https://templates.getgrist.com/5pHLanQNThxk/Payroll . Feel free to open it in a separate window, and try things yourself as you go along. The template addresses a few needs: We need to be able to add employees, and keep basic contact info for them. We need to set rates at which people are paid, and these rates can change over time. In our example, rates also vary by role: the same person could work as an Instructor in one program, and as a Coordinator in another, at different rates. We need to enter hours for each person. We need to get the monthly totals, both to enter data into our payroll service, and to verify that everything matches. The \u201cPeople\u201d Page # Let\u2019s start with the \u201cPeople\u201d tab in the example. It addresses our needs (1), (2), and (3). On top, we have a list of people, with contact info such as address and phone number. To add a new person, click into the last row of the PEOPLE table, and type in the data. Below that we have a card for the selected person \u2013 a handy way to view or update the selected person\u2019s record. Next to that are the rates for this person. We keep track of all rates, not only the latest one, along with each rate\u2019s effective date. To add a new rate, select a person, click into the last row of the RATES table, and enter the effective date into the Rate Start column (perhaps using the shortcut for today\u2019s date: \u2318 + ; (semicolon) on Mac or Ctrl + ; on Windows). Set the Role that it applies to, and the Hourly Rate . The Comment field is for your own notes. Don\u2019t modify values for existing rates, or past payroll computations will be affected. When you give someone a raise, add it as a new row. This way, full history is preserved, and is available for reference. The \u201cPayroll\u201d Page # To enter payroll hours, switch to the \u201cPayroll\u201d page. It is the most common task, so we placed this page first in the list of pages to have it open by default when you open the document. Scroll to the bottom (you can use these handy shortcuts: \u2318 \u2193 on Mac, Ctrl + \u2193 on Windows). To add a payroll entry, type in the date (or use the date picker), select the person using auto-complete, select their role, and type in their hours. The next few columns automatically look up the relevant rate, and calculate the payment. If you\u2019d like to enter hours for a range of dates, e.g. for a particular week, or for someone working full-time this month, you can use Date as the start date, and enter also an End Date . The interesting bit about this page is how the Per Hour rate is looked up. You don\u2019t need to care if you are just using the template, but if you enjoy looking under the hood, or if you need to customize this further to your needs, I\u2019ll explain it in detail below. The \u201cPay Periods\u201d Page # Here the totals for each period are automatically tallied up to address our need (5) \u2014 to see an overview, to enter data into a payroll system, and to check that everything matches. The latest pay period (in our case, a month) is on top of the top-left table. You can select any pay period there to see a pie chart with an overview of pay broken down by role, and a table of how much each person earned that month. The names and hours in the last table are typically all that a payroll service needs. In addition, we included a Dates column summarizing dates worked that month: for people working part time, it helps remember when the income was earned. It could be a handy note to include into a pay stub if your payroll service allows it. That\u2019s it! We now have a convenient and simple payroll tracker. Under the hood # I promised to show how rates are looked up. Open up the \u201cPayroll\u201d page, click on any cell in the Per Hour column, and hit Enter . The formula you see is an involved Python function, but it is intentionally broken up into bits, with comments explaining what each line does: # Get all the rates for the Person and Role in this row. rates = Rates.lookupRecords(Person=$Person, Role=$Role) # Pick out only those rates whose Rate_Start is on or before this row's Date. past_rates = [r for r in rates if r.Rate_Start <= $Date] # Select the latest of past_rates, i.e. maximum by Rate_Start. current_rate = max(past_rates, key=lambda r: r.Rate_Start) # Return the Hourly_Rate from the relevant Rates record. return current_rate.Hourly_Rate (If this seems too complicated, good luck trying to achieve the same in a traditional spreadsheet!) Read the comments in that code to understand the steps. For those who know Python, it may already make perfect sense. For those who don\u2019t, here are the relevant links to Grist and Python documentation: lookupRecords : how we look up all rates for the given person and role. list comprehensions : how we filter for only those rates with an earlier Rate_Start . max function : how we choose the rate record with the latest Rate_Start . .Field : how we get the Hourly_Rate field from the rate record. This formula is also a good illustration of how helpful it is to have Python available, along with multi-line formulas, variables, and comments.

You can click + button to easily create additional filters like this: To print out only a few labels out of a larger table, you can use the LabelCount column with a formula. This formula can produce 1 for a label that should be included, or 0 for a label that should not. The page \u201cFiltered By Formula\u201d shows an example, with the simple formula that includes only California addresses: IF($State == \"CA\", 1, 0) : The \u201cFiltered Manually\u201d page includes a Select for Print column.

We can then use the team members in rules, via a user attribute table : Then every user the document is shared with (other than owners) will see a filtered view of just those leads assigned to them: Read our introduction to access rules to learn more about what you can do with access rules.","title":"Per-user access"},{"location":"examples/2021-04-link-keys/","text":"Create Unique Links in 4 Steps # In Grist, \u201clink keys\u201d are URL parameters that when combined with the user.LinkKey variable in access rules will determine which data a link recipient is permitted to view. You can learn to do this in four easy steps. We\u2019ve created a simple template you can copy and edit as you follow along with this guide. In our example, you are a private tutor who uses Grist to track hours, payments, and client data. You would like to share session and payment history with parents via a link that only shows their family\u2019s data. A simple way to do that would be to set access rules that limit a link recipient\u2019s view to just those records tied to their family. Let\u2019s do that now. The private tutor can see all data, but a parent can only see their family\u2019s data. Step 1: Create a unique identifier # In the family\u2019s table, create a new column in which you will use Grist\u2019s UUID() function to generate and assign a unique key to each family. Convert the column to the data column to freeze its values, and set the default formula for new records to UUID() . This will ensure that new rows will also be assigned a unique identifier. Step 2: Connect UUID to records in other tables # In the Students, Sessions, and Payments tables, add a column that ties each record to the referenced family\u2019s UUID. Name these columns \u201cUUID\u201d, with the simple formula $Family.UUID . Not sure how this works? Brush up on Grist\u2019s powerful reference columns . Tip: The formula $Family.UUID gets the UUID from the record that is referenced in the Family column. Step 3: Create unique links # In the Families table, create a new column in which you will use Grist\u2019s SELF_HYPERLINK() function to generate hyperlinks. Use the formula SELF_HYPERLINK(LinkKey_UUID=$UUID) to create a link key called \u201cUUID\u201d that sets the URL parameter to a specific $UUID within a record. Convert the column type to Text > Hyperlink. How does this work? The link generated for \u201cRaddon, Fin\u201d is .../Private-Tutor-recUUID/p/9?UUID=6752c258-443d-4a2c-800d-1491da265b72 .

Reference columns tell Grist that two separate tables are related, and specifies which records within those tables are related. For example, if you have a table of Dogs and a table of Dog Owners , you may want each dog\u2019s record to explicitly reference their owner\u2019s record in Dog Owners . Reference columns are a powerful tool for looking up data from a related table, and for creating highly productive layouts. You can learn to do this in three easy steps. We\u2019ve created a simple template you can copy and edit as you follow along with this guide. Using Reference Columns to Organize Related Data # In our example, you are a graphic designer applying for jobs, and you are using Grist to keep track of your job application process. In the template you have four tables: Job Applications , Milestones , Tasks , and Contacts . Your goal is to relate relevant data between tables and create a custom dashboard where you can easily view each job application\u2019s status, and add new job applications and new milestones easily. In this dashboard , clicking on each job application shows only the milestones related to that job application. We can create this relationship using reference columns. Let\u2019s create this dashboard together. Step 1: Creating References # Reference columns are a type of column available under COLUMN TYPE. It is helpful to think of the table with the reference column as the referencing table , and the table which is being referenced as the underlying table . Converting Columns with Text into Reference Columns # If you already have text in the selected column, set the COLUMN TYPE in the right-side panel to \u201cReference\u201d. Grist will guess the underlying table and column you want to show in the reference column. You can review and edit this guess and set the appropriate underlying table and display column. DATA FROM TABLE points to the underlying table. SHOW COLUMN sets the display value in the reference column. For example, in the Milestones table, convert the Role column into a reference column. DATA FROM TABLE should point to Job Applications . SHOW COLUMN should be set to Role . Note that the reference column is referencing the entire record and you are choosing which column to display in the reference column. Tip: You can easily identify reference columns by the chain link icons in the column\u2019s cells. Creating Reference Columns # In the Contacts table we have a list of contacts that are not associated with any job application or company. Let\u2019s create a new column called Company , set its type to Reference, and point to Job Applications as the underlying table with Company as the display in the reference column. Click on the empty cell to open a drop-down menu and manually select the company at which each contact works. Look at the email address for a hint. Note: You can always click on a Reference Column cell to open the drop-down menu and select a new value. Step 2: Look up additional data in the referenced record # Recall that the reference column is referencing another table, and correlating two specific records. Although you see a specific column in the display of the reference column, the reference is being made to the entire record . This allows us to look up additional data fields in the related record using a simple formula. Let\u2019s try it. In step 1, in the Milestones table we created a reference column called Role . It would be useful to also see for each Milestone record, the relevant company. For example, in row 1 we see the Milestone event \u201cRejected!\u201d for the role \u201cHead of Digital Design\u201d. It is not immediately apparent which company this is. Let\u2019s use the Role reference column to easily look up the company listed in the \u201cHead of Digital Design\u201d record in the Job Applications table. To do so we create a column called Company and we use the formula $Role.Company . The formula structure is $[Reference Column ID in Referencing Table].[Column ID in Underlying Table] . Grist will also auto-complete parts of the formula as you type it. There\u2019s an alternative way to add multiple columns from an underlying table. If you\u2019re interested in learning more, visit our website\u2019s help section on reference columns . Step 3: Create a Highly Productive Layout with Linked Tables # One of the most powerful features of Grist is the ability to link related tables in the same page to create highly productive layouts. In the final dashboard shown at the start of this tutorial, we saw that clicking on a job application would populate a view of milestones related to that job application. Let\u2019s do that now by adding Milestones as a widget to the Job Applications page. ( Brush up on widgets here .) Adding the table as a Card List widget makes the data easier to view. Similarly, you may want to change the Job Applications table to a Card List widget. In the CARD LIST menu on the right, select DATA to set data selection rules. Under SELECT BY you will see the option \u201cJOB_APPLICATIONS Card List\u201d. This option is only available because in step 1 we created a reference from the Milestones table to the Job Applications table in the Role reference column. This reference tells Grist which milestones are related to which job applications. Congrats! You now know how to use reference columns to organize related data, give your data structure, and create linked widgets in productive layouts. If you\u2019d like, compare your document to the tutorial solution . Dig Deeper: Combining formulas and reference columns. # If you\u2019re comfortable with formulas, try using formulas in reference columns to make Grist an even more powerful tool. In the tutorial solution , we\u2019ve used a formula to do more. The formula in the Last Milestone field in the Job Applications widget is looking up the most recent date in related records in the Milestones table. Thus, adding a new milestone with a more recent date would automatically update this field. You can learn more about lookup formulas on our website . Because Last Milestone is both a formula column and a reference column, we\u2019ve also done the following which follows the formula described in step 2 of this tutorial. The Status field uses the formula $Last_Milestone.Round to look up the related milestone\u2019s round status. The Updated On field uses the formula $Last_Milestone.Date to look up the related milestone\u2019s date. By doing this, status and date also auto-update when the Last Milestone field updates.

They are similar to pivot tables in spreadsheets, and group-by functions in databases. They make it possible to summarize tables by grouping records into specific categories. For example, if you have a table of Olympic champions, it may be useful to group champion records by country or by sport \u2014 or by a combination of country and sport. Once records are sorted into useful categories, you may then want to compute sums using those record groups. Grist makes use of a nifty special field, available in formulas as $group . Summary tables make it easy to build pages in which you can quickly capture useful data insights. You can learn to do this by learning two concepts: creating summary tables, and using $group in formulas. We\u2019ve created a simple template ( https://public.getgrist.com/x527ESJATWNS/Time-Sheets-Tutorial ) that you can copy and edit as you follow along with this guide. Using Summary Tables to Analyze Data # In our example, you work for the HR department of a candy factory that hires contractors that work for various departments. In the template, your team has created an advanced time sheet tracker. There is a page where contractors can easily add time sheets for select months. It would be useful to have additional pages that summarize expenses by month, by department, and by contractor. Your goal in this tutorial is to build those summary pages. Creating Summary Tables # Step 1: Create a summary table # Let\u2019s start by creating a summary table that groups records in the time sheet table by month. Grist makes it easy to create summary tables. Simply click on Add New > Add Page > Time Sheet Entries > > Months . Doing so will generate a summary table with some columns. In this case we have the following three columns. First Column: List of month groups, January through June of 2021. Second Column: A count of the total number of records in each month, e.g. in January there are 12 time sheet records. Third Column: A sum of hours worked in each month, e.g. in January the total hours worked in those 12 time sheet records is 81 hours. Note: Grist will automatically take any numerical columns and add them up, saving you some time. Step 2: Create summary tables with multiple categories # It may be useful to also group timesheets by a combination of categories. For example, we may want to know how much time and money was spent on a particular account in a particular month, or on a specific employee in an specific account and month. When creating a summary table, you can select multiple columns by which to group data. Let\u2019s add two new summary tables. When adding these widgets, be sure to Select By the first widget we created on this page. This will link the tables so that selecting a month in the first widget will dynamically update records in the new widgets. Not sure why? Brush up on linking widgets . Add New > Add Widget to Page > Time Sheet Entries > > Months and Account Add New > Add Widget to Page > Time Sheet Entries > > Months and Account and Employee To more easily view this data, drag and drop the new tables so that they tile vertically. You may also want to hide the count columns. Great! But now we want to add the total dollar spend in each of these categories. That\u2019s simple to do with summary formulas. Calculating Totals Using Summary Formulas # Following along with the video? Visit the tutorial solution if you get stuck. Note that there are access rules in place for the tutorial solution which will prevent you from seeing certain pages and most data. Make a copy to become the document owner and see all data and pages. Step 1: Understanding $group field in formulas # In Grist, $group is a special Python object that represents a collection of records that are summarized by the current summary line. If you look at the formula in the Hours Worked column, you will see SUM($group.Hours_Worked) . That is taking the sum of Hours Worked in a group . In this example, in row 1, the group is January 2021. Thus, in that row, the formula is adding hours worked in the January 2021 group. In row 2, the group is February 2021 and the formula sums hours worked in February. If you take a peek at the count column, which we hid previously, you\u2019ll find the formula len($group) . The function len (which stands for length) counts all the records that belong to the group being summarized in a particular row. Another way to express a set of records is by scanning through the list of records in a group using a variable. You can name the variable as you wish; we will use r (for \u201crecord\u201d). We can rewrite the formula in Hours Worked as sum(r.Hours_Worked for r in $group) . Step 2: Using $group in formulas # Let\u2019s calculate the total dollar spend on hours worked in each month. The formula is sum(r.Hours_Worked * r.TimeSheet.Hourly_Rate for r in $group) . Since each record r in the group is a record in the underlying table ( Time Sheet Entries ), r.Hours_Worked refers to the field in that table. In the Time Sheet Entries table, the column TimeSheet is a reference column that is referencing an entire record in the Time Sheets table. Thus, we have to further specify which field from the referenced record should be included in the formula\u2019s calculation, which in this case is Hourly_Rate . To learn more about reference columns, visit our Reference column guide . We can apply the same formula to the other two summary tables on this page. In the second table, the $group function is grouping things in the same month AND account. In the third table, the $group function is grouping expenses in the same month AND account AND by the same employee. And that\u2019s it! You did it. You rebuilt the month summary page. See if you can apply these concepts to rebuild the contractor summary page. Did you know? If needed, you can also add conditions to this formula. For example, sum(r.Hours_Worked * r.TimeSheet.Hourly_Rate for r in $group if r.Hours_Worked > 0) will only add up records in which there is a positive value in the field Hours Worked .

In this case we have the following three columns. First Column: List of month groups, January through June of 2021. Second Column: A count of the total number of records in each month, e.g. in January there are 12 time sheet records. Third Column: A sum of hours worked in each month, e.g. in January the total hours worked in those 12 time sheet records is 81 hours. Note: Grist will automatically take any numerical columns and add them up, saving you some time.","title":"Step 1: Create a summary table"},{"location":"examples/2021-06-timesheets/#step-2-create-summary-tables-with-multiple-categories","text":"It may be useful to also group timesheets by a combination of categories. For example, we may want to know how much time and money was spent on a particular account in a particular month, or on a specific employee in an specific account and month. When creating a summary table, you can select multiple columns by which to group data. Let\u2019s add two new summary tables. When adding these widgets, be sure to Select By the first widget we created on this page. This will link the tables so that selecting a month in the first widget will dynamically update records in the new widgets. Not sure why? Brush up on linking widgets . Add New > Add Widget to Page > Time Sheet Entries > > Months and Account Add New > Add Widget to Page > Time Sheet Entries > > Months and Account and Employee To more easily view this data, drag and drop the new tables so that they tile vertically. You may also want to hide the count columns. Great! But now we want to add the total dollar spend in each of these categories. That\u2019s simple to do with summary formulas.","title":"Step 2: Create summary tables with multiple categories"},{"location":"examples/2021-06-timesheets/#calculating-totals-using-summary-formulas","text":"Following along with the video?

If you look at the formula in the Hours Worked column, you will see SUM($group.Hours_Worked) . That is taking the sum of Hours Worked in a group . In this example, in row 1, the group is January 2021. Thus, in that row, the formula is adding hours worked in the January 2021 group. In row 2, the group is February 2021 and the formula sums hours worked in February. If you take a peek at the count column, which we hid previously, you\u2019ll find the formula len($group) . The function len (which stands for length) counts all the records that belong to the group being summarized in a particular row. Another way to express a set of records is by scanning through the list of records in a group using a variable. You can name the variable as you wish; we will use r (for \u201crecord\u201d). We can rewrite the formula in Hours Worked as sum(r.Hours_Worked for r in $group) .","title":"Step 1: Understanding $group field in formulas"},{"location":"examples/2021-06-timesheets/#step-2-using-group-in-formulas","text":"Let\u2019s calculate the total dollar spend on hours worked in each month. The formula is sum(r.Hours_Worked * r.TimeSheet.Hourly_Rate for r in $group) . Since each record r in the group is a record in the underlying table ( Time Sheet Entries ), r.Hours_Worked refers to the field in that table. In the Time Sheet Entries table, the column TimeSheet is a reference column that is referencing an entire record in the Time Sheets table. Thus, we have to further specify which field from the referenced record should be included in the formula\u2019s calculation, which in this case is Hourly_Rate . To learn more about reference columns, visit our Reference column guide . We can apply the same formula to the other two summary tables on this page. In the second table, the $group function is grouping things in the same month AND account. In the third table, the $group function is grouping expenses in the same month AND account AND by the same employee. And that\u2019s it! You did it. You rebuilt the month summary page. See if you can apply these concepts to rebuild the contractor summary page. Did you know? If needed, you can also add conditions to this formula. For example, sum(r.Hours_Worked * r.TimeSheet.Hourly_Rate for r in $group if r.Hours_Worked > 0) will only add up records in which there is a positive value in the field Hours Worked .

Grist makes it simple to create columns that stamp the time or a user\u2019s name to a record when it is updated or created. This makes it possible to sort records by age, determine how long a record has existed, or quickly track the most recent edit to its author. This is especially useful when working in a team. Suppose you have a document tracking sales opportunities. It may be useful to know the last time a sales person took action on a particular opportunity, and further determine for how long that opportunity has been pending. We\u2019ve created a tutorial based on our Grant Application Tracker template. To follow along with this guide, start with this incomplete version of the template that is missing time and user stamp columns. We will recreate those together in this tutorial. Create a copy and edit the template as you follow along with this guide. Open Tutorial Template Template Overview: Grant Application Tracker # In this template, an NGO focused on ocean conservation projects tracks their grant applications submitted to marine-focused foundations. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the document structure. The Applications Dashboard shows all applications, application details, foundation details, and related tasks in one helpful view. Tasks by Staff lists the NGO\u2019s personnel, the applications they\u2019re overseeing, and tasks assigned to each team member. Our Programs lists the programs the NGO is seeking to fund. Our Funding Overview provides an overview of funding with two charts: (i) breakdown of funds in the fundraising pipeline, and (ii) breakdown of total funding awarded to specific NGO programs. Foundations We Work With lists the foundations to which the NGO has applied for funding. This page also lists related applications and tasks. Creating Time Stamp Columns # Columns can stamp the time when a record was created or updated by using the NOW() formula. Let\u2019s add a column to the Tasks table to track when a task was last updated. This can be accomplished in three steps. In the Tasks table, create a column labeled \u2018Last Updated\u2019 and in column types, select DateTime to select your desired format for date and time . Convert the column to a data column by clicking the ACTIONS dropdown in the creator panel. This prevents the formula from triggering whenever the document loads. Once converted to a data column, enter the NOW() formula. You will see two checkbox options below the formula. Apply to new records triggers the formula only when a record is created. Apply on record changes triggers the formula when a record is updated. Select Apply on record changes to open a submenu where you may select which fields, when updated, will trigger the formula. In this case, we\u2019ll select Any Field which means that updating any field in this record will trigger the time stamp formula to update. Great! You are now tracking when a task was last updated. Next, you may want to know who created a task because that person may have the most information about the task\u2019s goals and parameters. That\u2019s just as simple to create in Grist as time stamps. Creating User Stamp Columns # User stamps are created using the exact same steps as time stamps, expect for one detail \u2014 the formula is user.Name . Let\u2019s add a column to the Tasks table to track who created a task. In the Tasks table, create a column labeled \u2018Created By\u2019 and in column types, select Text and modify the format if you wish. Convert formula column to a data column and enter the user.Name formula. Select Apply to new records so that the formula only triggers when a new record is created. There are other possibilities available in addition to user.Name such as user.Email or a unique user.UserID . The user information available is the same as that in access rule conditions . Note. It is still possible for a user to manually edit cells with time stamp or user stamp formulas. If you don\u2019t want that to be allowed, use access rules to forbid it. And that\u2019s it! You\u2019ve created columns that capture user and time stamp information based on specific triggers, such as when a record is updated or created. Great job! Dig Deeper: Combining time and user stamps using formulas # Typically it is best practice to keep time and user stamp information in separate columns so that you may later sort and filter by those columns. However, there may be times when it would be useful to capture both time and user stamp information in the same column. Let\u2019s add such a column to the Applications table. In the Applications table, create a column labeled \u2018Created At\u2019 and convert to a data column. In column types, select Text. Enter the formula \"{:%b %d, %Y} by {}\".format(NOW(), user.Name) . The part in quotes is a format string.

Quick Tips # Date Offsets. It is easy to get into muddles calculating dates. DATEADD is an easy and reliable way to add years, months, weeks, and days to a date. For example, to calculate three months on from a specific date, do DATEADD($date, months=3) . For a week and a day before that, do DATEADD($date, months=3, weeks=-1, day=-1) . Simple! Column Names. Sometimes, there is a tension between choosing a column name as a verbose label to explain what it is about, and choosing something short and snappy that is comfortable in formulas. You can have both! Just open the column options and uncheck \u201c Use Name as ID? \u201d. Then you can set the name used as a label and the name used in formulas separately. And as always with Grist, if you change your mind later you can change or relink the names and all your formulas will update automatically. What\u2019s New # Sort your documents by modification date. You can now choose to order your documents so that the most recently changed ones show up first, using the new By Name / By Date Modified option at the top right of document lists. List documents as icons. You may now also control whether documents show as a grid of icons or as a list of names, using the new grid and stack icons at the top right of document lists. Reactive custom widgets. We have made it simple for web developers to create Custom Widgets that offer new reactive views of your data that update automatically. A developer need only call grist.onRecord(s) to subscribe to a record or a set of records linked to the widget; after that, presentation is a matter of preparing HTML/CSS/JS assets (no Grist-specific knowledge needed). The user of the widget controls data selection using regular Widget Linking . We invite web developers to have a go at building new widgets or visualizations, and we\u2019d be excited to hear about the results (shoot us a mail at support@getgrist.com ).

Quick Tips # Keyboard Shortcuts. Grist supports many keyboard shortcuts, including quite a few from Excel and Google Sheets. These are listed here , and also available within Grist by pressing F1 or \u2318 / (Mac) or Ctrl + / (Windows). Referenced Columns. With the cursor anywhere in a column of type Reference (used to store a pointer to another record), the Column Options panel on the right has a section called \u201cAdd Referenced Columns\u201d. It allows quickly adding any field from the linked record. If you hit Enter on the added column, you\u2019ll notice that it is simply a formula column, such as $Contact.Email . What\u2019s New # Public Sharing. You can now share your documents publicly. In the \u201cShare\u201d menu ( ) on top, select \u201cManage Users\u201d. Then toggle the dropdown next to \u201cPublic Access\u201d to \u201cOn\u201d: Once you confirm the change, anyone with the link to your document will be able to view it. They don\u2019t even need to have a Grist login. The \u201cCopy Link\u201d button is handy to copy the link to the clipboard for pasting into an email, tweet, or anywhere else. You can also allow anyone with the link to your document to edit it: simply switch the role in the Public Access row to Editor. Note that this allows anyone with the link to change absolutely anything in your document, including deleting all the data. The snapshots in Document History should help if anything goes wrong. Improved Formula Suggestions. While typing in formulas, Grist is now more helpful in suggesting common functions, and includes their parameters, and a link to documentation.

Quick Tips # Fill a Range. To fill a range of cells with the same value, enter the value in the top cell, then select the range below starting with this cell (which you can do by dragging the mouse, or Shift -clicking the bottom cell), then press Ctrl + D (Windows) or \u2318 D (Mac). Remember it as \u201cD\u201d for filling D own. The usual Copy-Paste shortcuts work too \u2013 Ctrl + C Ctrl + V (Windows) or \u2318 C \u2318 V (Mac). Pasting a value into a larger range will fill the range with multiple copies of the value. Conditional Expressions. If you have a formula like $Birthday.year , you\u2019ll find that when the Birthday column is empty, the formula shows an error. It\u2019s easy to avoid it using Python\u2019s conditional expressions: $Birthday.year if $Birthday else None The same idea can help in other situations, e.g. to avoid a ZeroDivisionError: $Total / $Count if $Count else 0 What\u2019s New # Printing.

It\u2019s easy to avoid it using Python\u2019s conditional expressions: $Birthday.year if $Birthday else None The same idea can help in other situations, e.g. to avoid a ZeroDivisionError: $Total / $Count if $Count else 0","title":"Quick Tips"},{"location":"newsletters/2020-10/#whats-new","text":"Printing.

Open Source Announcement # We are happy to announce the beta release of the open source version of Grist ! As a modern, powerful spreadsheet, Grist fits well into the open-source ecosystem, and is as friendly to hacker-developers as to hacker-users. Join the discussion at HackerNews . Read the announcement . This will interest technically-minded users who\u2019d like to extend Grist, or those with unusual requirements. Meanwhile, the service you know and love remains the best supported and cost-efficient option, and will benefit from the increased confidence in Grist source code. Quick Tips # Add a Record. Some of the simplest shortcuts are the most useful. To add a record, press Ctrl + = (Windows) or \u2318 = (Mac). Press Shift at the same time to insert the record above the cursor rather than below. Cook up a Unique Identifier. Let\u2019s say you\u2019d like to refer to records in a table, but don\u2019t have a column that identifies each record uniquely. Perhaps you have people with First_Name and Last_Name , or sessions with Program_Name and Date . To use such tables as a destination of a Reference column, you\u2019ll need a unique identifier. You can create one using a formula that stitches together the fields that identify a record uniquely. For example, create a column Full_Name with the formula $Last_Name + \", \" + $First_Name or a column Session_Name with the formula \"[%s] %s\" % ($Date, $Program_Name) The latter is Python syntax for formatting strings: each occurrence of %s in the quoted string is replaced by a value from the list in parentheses. What\u2019s New # Improved Attachments. The preview of attachments has been vastly improved, and supports showing PDF, video, and audio files. Simply double-click a cell with attachments to preview its content: View Differences. You can now view differences between a copy of a document you make using \u201cWork on a Copy\u201d and the original, as well as what changed since a backup snapshot in the document\u2019s history. Find the \u201cCompare\u201d menu item in the Share menu: This feature is experimental for now, but is already quite useful: This supports the workflow of trying out changes , which should be familiar to users of version control systems such as Git. One of its benefits is allowing view-only users to propose changes, even though they cannot edit the document directly.

Quick Tips # Totals. To compute totals of a column, spreadsheet users will often reach for the last row of their table to enter a formula there. In Grist, every row is a database record, including the last row. But totals are certainly available! Instead of adding a row for totals, add a one-line summary table. Click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button, and select \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In the dialog that opens, click the summation icon ( ) next to the table you\u2019d like totals for: Click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d, and you\u2019ll see a one-line summary of your table. Use the drag handle just to the left of the title to move it below your table (where you normally expect totals). Grist creates sums of all numeric columns automatically.

Access rules # Grist now offers \u201caccess rules\u201d for fine-grained control of who can see (or edit) which parts of your document at the table, column, and row level. In December, we invited those interested in early access to try the feature out. We\u2019ve made a lot of improvements, and are now excited to open the feature to the public. Things to know about access rules: Until now, everyone you shared a document with saw the same content. Now, their views can be filtered. For example, a table or column may be visible only to certain users. Or some users may see only rows that meet a condition. Until now, all editors and owners of a document could change anything about its content. Now, document owners can control what specific editors can change. For example, a table or column may be locked for certain editors. Or some editors may only update, add, or remove rows that meet a condition. If you need it, editors can be organized into groups or teams using a table within the document itself, and granted permissions systematically. You can make special links to give ad-hoc view access to pieces of the document, including documents shared with the public. Access rules are marked as a Beta feature, meaning that the design of access rules is likely to evolve, and sometimes that will require updates to documents that use them. We won\u2019t make such changes lightly. Grist access rules put great power in your hands. With that power comes great responsibility. Take your time to read our documentation , explore the examples , and test the rules you create . Feel free to reach out to consult us as well, at support@getgrist.com . We\u2019ll be glad to help. New Example # Access rules let you control how a shared document is used, and maintain a separation of roles and responsibilities. In our Lead List example, we suppose an entrepeneur is using Grist as an ad-hoc lead tracker for sales and potential advisors, and show how they can use access rules to shape collaboration. Quick Tips # Cell Color . You can add a splash of color to a column using the Cell Color option for Columns (in tables) or Fields (in cards). The color will apply consistently in all views where cells from that column appear. SQL Queries . Grist documents are also downloadable SQL databases, in SQLite format. If you download your document (via the button) you can query it using the standard sqlite3 tool (available on the SQLite site ) or from just about any language or database tool. Your tables and columns in Grist will show up exactly as SQLite tables and columns. Here\u2019s a query against the Lead List example document: You may not need to do this often, but when you do it is very handy. We\u2019ve recently improved the fit between SQLite column types and Grist column types, so if a database importer fails to recognize a column, try recreating the column or converting it to a more precise type (e.g. Integer, Text, Numeric, Date, DateTime etc).

Understanding Link Sharing # Last month we released granular access controls which makes it possible to limit who can see or edit which parts of a document, down to individual columns and rows. This same level of control can be set for documents shared via links with third parties who do not have a Grist account or who are not a part of your organization. For example, you may want to share purchase history with a customer, permit staff to see only their work schedules, or show a client their project\u2019s status. In Grist, \u201clink keys\u201d are URL parameters that when combined with the access control rules will determine which data a link recipient is permitted to view. Creating Unique Link Keys in 4 Steps # The best way to learn is by doing. We\u2019ve created a simple template you can copy and edit to deepen your understanding of link sharing. In our example, you are a private tutor who uses Grist to track hours, payments, and client data. You would like to share session and payment history with parents via a link that only shows their family\u2019s data. Follow our 4 step guide to learn how to share limited data via links . The private tutor can see all data, but a parent can only see their family\u2019s data. Learn How What\u2019s New # You can now create filter buttons in a bar above any view in Grist. The filter bar can be toggled on or off, and edited to only include buttons for those columns you commonly filter by. The bar can also be saved so that everyone with access to the doc can more easily filter data. Quick Tips # Freezing unique identifiers . When using the Grist\u2019s UUID() function, you may want to freeze values assigned to each record. If you don\u2019t, the unique identifier will generate anew when you re-open the doc. To freeze unique identifiers, convert the column to the data column, and set the default formula for new records to UUID() so that new rows will also be assigned a unique identifier. Creating links in cells . To create a column of links in Grist, set the column type to Text, and click the \u201cHyperLink\u201d button under Cell Format. Link Keys and Public Access. If you\u2019re generating unique links to limited views of data, make sure you have turned on Public Access under \u201cManage Users\u201d to allow link-sharing. Viewers who access your document via links will still be limited in accordance with your access rules. Still need help?

Organizing Data with Reference Columns # Reference columns are at the heart of what Grist does best: make it easy to set up a relational database and create highly productive layouts. If you\u2019re not familiar with databases, understanding reference columns can feel a little tricky. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created a simple template you can copy and edit to deepen your understanding of reference columns. In our example, you are a job applicant who uses Grist to track your job application status at multiple companies. You would like a simple dashboard that makes it easy to see your job status at a glance, and to add new jobs, interviews and other milestones. Follow our 3 step guide to learn how to use reference columns . What\u2019s New # Choice Lists # You can now select multiple options in a Choice List column. In the screenshot below, multiple dog shows are selected from a choice list, instead of just one. Search Improvements # When searching in Grist, the search now stays on the same page by default. If you want to search across all pages, simply mark the checkbox. Hyperlinks within Same Document # Previously all hyperlinks opened in a new tab. Now, hyperlinks that point to a different part of the same document will open in the same tab. This makes it easier to jump to relevant parts of large documents. Quick Tips # Adding new record from reference column drop-down list. You may add a new value to the dropdown list in a reference column without switching to the underlying table. Just type in the value you want to add and select the + value in the dropdown list. Grist will automatically add a new record containing this value to the underlying table and insert the proper reference. Edit Card Widget Layout. When converting a table into a card widget, you may want to move fields around to a more intuitive format. Click on the ... menu above the widget you\u2019d like to edit, then select EDIT LAYOUT. Click and drag fields to reposition them, then click SAVE LAYOUT. Card List Widget Themes. The card list widget tiles cards vertically.

When converting a table into a card widget, you may want to move fields around to a more intuitive format. Click on the ... menu above the widget you\u2019d like to edit, then select EDIT LAYOUT. Click and drag fields to reposition them, then click SAVE LAYOUT. Card List Widget Themes. The card list widget tiles cards vertically.

What\u2019s New # Freeze Columns # You can now freeze columns in Grist! Tame those wide spreadsheets and view your data, your way. Read-only Editor # Team members with view-only access can now open a cell editor to more easily read long text, access attachments, or take a peek at formulas. They will still be prevented from editing the cell, as indicated by the gray lock icon. Read-only cell editor locked for edits v. unrestricted cell editor Quick Tips # Duplicate Document v Work on a Copy. When making changes to a document\u2019s structure it\u2019s a good practice to Work on a copy . This does not automatically save a duplicate of your document. It creates an unsaved working copy where you can make edits, and then choose to replace the current document, copy your new edits to a new document, or discard your changes altogether. Duplicate Document does create a new, duplicated document, and you can choose whether or not to copy data or retain only the document\u2019s structure. Exporting Backups. Grist periodically takes snapshots of your documents. You can save any version of your document (current or historical snapshots) to backup your data. To backup historical snapshots, click on Document History then Snapshots . Select any snapshot\u2019s menu then click on Open Snapshot . Click on the share icon to open a menu from which you can download the entire document as a Grist file . Combining text fields with formulas. You may sometimes have text in multiple columns that you would like to display in one column. For example, a table may have first name and last name columns. You may easily create a full name column with the formula \"{}, {}\".format($Last_Name, $First_Name) . The part in quotes is a format string: each set of curly brackets ( {} ) in it gets replaced with the next value from parentheses after format . In this case, the full name would be displayed as Benson, Carla . Dig Deeper # Analyzing Data with Summary Tables and Formulas # Summary tables and formulas are vital tools in capturing actionable insights from your data. They make it possible to group records into specific categories, then compute sums using those record groups. Grist makes it easy to create summary tables and work with the $group field in summary formulas. We\u2019ve created a video tutorial that helps you master two key concepts: summary tables and summary formulas. The tutorial guides you into building two summary pages in an advanced timesheet tracker template. LEARN: Summary Tables New Template # Advanced Timesheet Tracker # The timesheet tracker makes it easier to track contractors\u2019 timesheets across various months and departments. It has a dashboard where contractors can submit their hours directly into Grist, and see only their historical timesheet data. The company\u2019s payroll department can see everyone\u2019s timesheets, in all accounts, across all months, and have access to summary pages that provide useful data around spending. They can also set permissions to allow or disallow timesheet edits in certain months. The summary tables tutorial starts with an unfinished version of the template, and guides you into creating two new pages. If you want to use the completed template, go to the tutorial solution. Note that there are access rules in place for the completed template which will prevent you from seeing certain pages and most data.

When creating a reference column it is best practice to choose a display column that is a unique identifier for the record. For example, for records of people, it could be full name or email. To show other data, such as department or birthday, pull it in using the formula $[Reference Column Id].[Referenced Record\u2019s Field] , (for example $Person.Department ). You may review how this formula works in our reference column guide . Labeling hyperlinks with text. In hyperlink columns, you can label a link with text by adding a label before the url: [link label] url . The brackets are not needed. Using Search to Find a Card. If you have a card widget on a page and quickly want to find the right card, you can use the search bar on the page to quickly bring the relevant card into view.

WATCH RECORDING Access Rules Video # Limiting access for team members Access rules are a beta feature of Grist which make it possible to limit access to parts of your data based on custom rules. The rules can be very granular and grant view or edit permissions based on a number of variables. The most common use of access rules is for teams who want to limit which records team members can see. For example, it is often desirable for sales representatives to only see records related to their owns sales, while their manager can see all records. We cover how to set up those rules in a 5 minute video. WATCH VIDEO Community Highlights # Overtime Calculator. Automatically calculate and keep track of weekly overtime rates. Calculating terms.
