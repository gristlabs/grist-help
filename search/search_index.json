At the top of the left-side menu, click \u2018Add New\u2019 button and select \u2018Add Page\u2019 or \u2018Add Widget to Page\u2019. In the widget picker, select the <code>Orders</code> table then click the summation icon () next to it. Add the page or widget to your document. Done! You\u2019ve now created a summary table that by default counts all the records in the <code>Orders</code> table, and sums all numeric and integer columns, such as the amount sold in each order.</p> <p>Summary tables can do more than a sum of a tables\u2019 columns. With just a few clicks you can summarize orders by month to calculate the number of orders and total sales revenue in each month for which you have data. </p> <p>Take it a step further and suppose you have multiple webstores. With Grist, you can record all sales orders across all stores and months in the same table. Then, you can summarize by month and webstore. </p> <p>When you add more months (or stores!) to the orders table, the summary table will automatically update, which is another key difference with spreadsheets. In Excel, you would need to expand your formula\u2019s range, or add more sheets and modify formulas everytime you added more sales orders, months, or stores. In Grist, you create the summary table once, and let Grist do the future work for you.</p> <p>In addition to our summary tables article, we have a video tutorial and follow-along guide that provides an example in building a dashboard with summary tables.</p>"},{"location":"FAQ/#sharing","title":"Sharing","text":""},{"location":"FAQ/#whats-the-difference-between-a-team-member-and-a-guest","title":"What\u2019s the difference between a team member and a guest?","text":"<p>Team members all have access to a team site, which is located at a url with a custom subdomain, such as <code>your-team.getgrist.com</code>.

Grist offers a feature called \u201clink keys\u201d that can help with that.  Any parameters in a Grist document URL that end in an underscore are made available to access rules in a <code>user.LinkKey</code> variable.  So for example if a document URL ends in <code>....?Token_=xx-xx-xx-xx&amp;Flavor_=vanilla</code>, then <code>user.LinkKey.Token</code> will be set to <code>xx-xx-xx-xx</code> and <code>user.LinkKey.Flavor</code> to <code>vanilla</code>. Let\u2019s work through an example to see how that can be helpful.</p> <p>Suppose we have a table of <code>Orders</code> and we\u2019d like to occasionally share information about a single order with someone.  To do that with link keys, we need some kind of hard-to-guess code for each order, which can be used to access it.

We set the formula to apply to new records:</p> <p></p> <p>At this point we have a solid hard-to-guess code for each order in the UUID column, that will be created as we add new orders.  It can be handy at this point to construct links to the document with that code embedded in them.  Grist has a helper for this called <code>SELF_HYPERLINK</code>.  To add a link key called <code>&lt;NAME&gt;</code>, just use this function with a <code>LinkKey_&lt;NAME&gt;</code> argument.  In our case, we pass <code>LinkKey_UUID=$UUID</code> to embed the value of the UUID column into the URL.  We also set <code>label=$Ref</code> to control the text label of the link in the spreadsheet.  To show the link, we set the column type to \u2018Text\u2019 and set the \u2018HyperLink\u2019 option:</p> <p></p> <p>Once we have these links, we can tidy up a little by hiding the UUID and Ref columns (see Column operations for a refresher on how to do this):</p> <p></p> <p>The links don\u2019t do anything special yet, but we have everything we need to make that happen now.

An \u201cenrollment\u201d represents one student being enrolled in one class. It has some useful properties of its own: the enrollment status (Confirmed, Waitlisted, or Cancelled), whether they have paid for the class, and perhaps more.</p> <p>In database design, this is known as a \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationship. The extra table is known as a \u201cjoin\u201d table.

For example, \u201cNet Profit\u201d provides more context than a column labeled \u201cD\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set the column type of the formula column before asking the assistant for help. This helps the assistant guess what type of values you\u2019d like returned.</p> </li> <li> <p>Think about the type of value you expect to see in the formula, and frame the question with that in mind. For example, if you want a formula that returns True or False in a Toggle column, ask a yes-or-no question. Otherwise, the assistant may suggest a formula that lists all rows where something is true (and is technically correct), but you were hoping for a simple true or false per row.</p> </li> <li> <p>The assistant is conversational. If you are not satisfied with a suggested formula, explain to the assistant where the formula fell short and ask it to make a change.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sometimes the assistant gets stuck on a bad idea. If it keeps insisting on a particular formula method, consider clearing the conversation and starting over. Click the three dot menu in the AI Assistant header to clear a conversation. </p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Remember that Grist formulas apply to the whole column.

For example, to filter column <code>pet</code> for values <code>cat</code> and <code>dog</code>, the filter would be <code>{\"pet\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"]}</code>. JSON contains characters that are not safe to place in a URL, so it is important to url-encode them.  For this example, the url-encoding is <code>%7B%22pet%22%3A%20%5B%22cat%22%2C%20%22dog%22%5D%7D</code>. See https://rosettacode.org/wiki/URL_encoding for how to url-encode a string, or https://www.urlencoder.org/ to try some examples. Multiple columns can be filtered. For example the filter for <code>pet</code> being either <code>cat</code> or <code>dog</code>, AND <code>size</code> being either <code>tiny</code> or <code>outrageously small</code>, would be <code>{\"pet\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"], \"size\": [\"tiny\", \"outrageously small\"]}</code>.</p> sortstring Example: sort=pet,-age<p>Order in which to return results. If a single column name is given (e.g. <code>pet</code>), results are placed in ascending order of values in that column. To get results in an order that was previously prepared manually in Grist, use the special <code>manualSort</code> column name. Multiple columns can be specified, separated by commas (e.g. <code>pet,age</code>). For descending order, prefix a column name with a <code>-</code> character (e.g. <code>pet,-age</code>). To include additional sorting options append them after a colon (e.g. <code>pet,-age:naturalSort;emptyFirst,owner</code>). Available options are: <code>choiceOrder</code>, <code>naturalSort</code>, <code>emptyFirst</code>. Without the <code>sort</code> parameter, the order of results is unspecified.</p> limitnumber Example: limit=5<p>Return at most this number of rows.

You can see this example here.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Countries table lists each Country as a unique record. The Cities table creates a relationship between a city and a country. Each City is its own record, assigned to its corresponding Country in the adjacent reference column. The Stadiums table is linked to both tables via reference columns: Stadium Country references the Countries table, and Stadium City references the Cities table.</p> <p>To filter a reference column\u2019s dropdown list \u2013 here, the Stadium City column \u2013 first select the reference column, then click \u2018Set dropdown condition\u2019 in the Creator Panel under the \u2018Column\u2019 tab.</p> <p></p> <p>By writing a condition as a formula, you can filter the choices found in the column\u2019s dropdown lists. The attribute <code>choice</code> refers to the choices in the dropdown. </p> <p></p> <p>Here, the formula is <code>choice.Country == $Stadium_Country</code></p> <p><code>choice.Country</code> looks at the value in the Country column of the Cities table. If it matches the value in the Stadium Country column of the Stadiums table, then that record will be included in the dropdown options.</p> <p> </p> <p>Now, instead of showing a list of all world cities, the dropdown list in the Stadium City column only lists choices that belong to the country entered in the Stadium Country column, making it much faster to select the appropriate choice.</p> <p>The <code>choice</code> attribute can also be used when setting dropdown filter conditions for choice and choice list columns.</p> <p>Note that because reference dropdown filtering conditions are written as formulas, these conditions can be very flexible and granular. Users experienced with access rules may notice similarities in how to think about writing these formulas.</p>"},{"location":"col-transform/","title":"Column Transformations","text":"<p>Grist offers two ways to transform all values in a column.

The first parameter to the function is    the string to parse, the second parameter is the date format that the string is in. Take a look    at the format    options to see if    the example format string <code>%B %d, %Y</code> makes sense.

We can use this column as a link to Table1 to pull other data. <code>$Mix_Product.Lt_per_100_Lt</code> uses the reference list column, Mix Product, to pull values from the Lt per 100 Lt column of Table1 for the products listed in the Mix Product column of Table2 then assigns this list of values to the variable <code>mix_list_str</code>. This is the same formula used in the Lt per 100 Lt column of Table2 so you can see the value it returns in row 1 of Table2. It returns a list: <code>['0.2355', '1.2579']</code>. This list is evaluated as a string rather than numerical values. We need to convert each value in this list to a float.</p> <p>In our next formula, <code>[float(i) for i in mix_list_str]</code>, we iterate through the list that was assigned in the first equation to <code>mix_list_str</code> and convert each value to a floating-point number. We want to convert to a float rather than integer because not all values are whole numbers and contain decimals. <code>i</code> is a variable representing each value. So each value in <code>mix_list_str</code> is evaluated in the equation <code>float(i)</code>. <code>float(0.2355)</code> converts <code>0.2355</code> to a float and <code>float(1.2579)</code> converts <code>1.2579</code> to a float. Now, we assign our list of floats to the variable <code>mix_list_float</code>.</p> <p>We can now use our float values in a mathematical equation. Once again, we iterate through the list that was assigned to the variable <code>mix_list_float</code>. In our equation <code>[Lt * $Water/100 for Lt in mix_list_float]</code>, <code>Lt</code> represents each value in <code>mix_list_float</code> and <code>$Water</code> represents the value found in the Water column which is <code>1000</code>. We evaluate the equation <code>Lt * 1000/100</code> when <code>Lt = 0.2355</code> and <code>Lt = 1.2579</code> which returns the list <code>[2.355, 12.579]</code>. We assign this list to the variable <code>x</code>.</p> <p>To round the values in <code>x</code> to two decimal places, we need to evaluate the equation <code>ROUND(num, 2)</code> where num represents each value in our list and 2 specifies the number of decimal places we want to round to. This returns the list <code>[2.36, 12.58]</code> which we assign to the variable round_x.</p> <p>In the first equation, we used our reference list column, Mix Product, as our link to Table1 in order to pull data from Table1 into Table2.

We use Python\u2019s format method to format our string. <code>{}</code> is a placeholder for each variable listed in <code>.format()</code>. Last, we use Python\u2019s zip() function to pair the first values from each list together and then pair the second values in each list together. <code>l</code> is assigned as our <code>first</code> list and <code>round_x</code> is assigned as our <code>second</code> list. <code>l = [Prod A, Prod B]</code> and <code>round_x = [2.36, 12.58]</code>. Zipping our lists into <code>'{} {}'.format(first, second)</code> gives us <code>Prod A 2.36</code> in our first iteration and <code>Prod B 12.58</code> in our second iteration.

It may also be useful to store independent  data in a column, but still use a formula to calculate it in some situations. This is exactly what Trigger Formulas offer. It is a very powerful feature that allows you to create a Timestamp or Authorship column, recalculate your data based on a set of conditions that you decide , clean data when a new value is entered, or provide sensible default value for a column.</p> <p>To create a Trigger Formula column, you first need to open the creator panel and  click on the <code>Set trigger formula</code> action. If you want to convert an existing formula, use the <code>Convert to trigger formula</code> action available in the <code>COLUMN BEHAVIOR</code> section.</p> <p></p> <p>To control when the formula is evaluated, use the two checkbox options  below:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><code>Apply to new records</code> triggers the formula only when a new record is  created (a default cell value).</li> <li><code>Apply on record changes</code> triggers the formula when a record is updated.</li> </ul> <p>Applying to new records is self-explanatory, the formula will be evaluated only once when you add a new record. It is a perfect solution to provide  default values to the empty cells. Second option allows you to fine grain  the conditions and specify which columns, when updated, will trigger the  evaluation:</p> <p></p> <p>You probably noticed the first option <code>Current field</code>. At first glance, you probably wonder: \u201cWhy would I want to trigger the column on its own  change?\u201d. This option allows you to react to a value that is being entered  into the column, just before it is saved!</p> <p>In the formula editor, you have access to two variables that are not  available to regular formulas:</p> <ul> <li><code>value</code> which is the value that a user wants to enter,</li> <li><code>user</code> which represents a user object that is making the change (you will also see this in the Access rules section).</li> </ul> <p>This allows you to make your application even smarter, track when a record was updated, or see who made the last change to a row. Simple examples:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Ensure that the value in a column is always written in capital letters:   With the trigger formula of <code>value.upper()</code>, the value typed into this column will be converted to upper case automatically.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Format a value that the user enters to sanitize the data before saving:  With the formula like <code>value if value.startswith(\"SK\") else \"SK\" + value</code>, the value typed into this column will always be prefixed with \u201cSK\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>Overwrite a default value from a referenced table:  You can use a formula like <code>value or $Client.Phone</code>, to provide a default value from a referenced table, but still allow the user to type a new one.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In each of these examples, when the user tries to modify a cell, Grist (before updating the record) will evaluate the formula and store its result in the column instead of the value provided by the user. </p> <p>For a detailed, real-life example read our guide on how to create time and user stamps.</p> <p>For more information on formulas and trigger formulas, check out our webinar Trigger Formulas v.

Now let\u2019s look at an example of Grist sending data to an outside service.  Continuing our form example, where a Grist document is accumulating votes for a preferred color: now suppose that every time a new vote comes in we want to send an email summarizing which option is in the lead.  We write a formula to prepare the text in a <code>Text</code> cell:</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s return again to the Grist integration page on Zapier.  There are several mail integrations.  For this example, we pick Gmail:</p> <p></p> <p>Once we\u2019ve picked the service to connect, now we choose exactly what we want it to do.  In this case, we choose that when there is a <code>New or Updated Record (Instant)</code> in Grist, we will <code>Send Email</code> in Gmail.  Note the <code>Instant</code> there.  Triggers in Zapier can be either a regular kind where Zapier periodically checks for changes (this is relatively slow), or a special \u201cinstant\u201d kind that needs special support from the triggering service but is a lot faster. Grist supports either kind of trigger, and we strongly recommend \u201cinstant\u201d if you prefer results in seconds rather than minutes, and especially if you are the sort to get anxious if someone doesn\u2019t respond to your IMs immediately.</p> <p></p> <p>Once we\u2019ve chosen a Grist account to use as before, we can pick a table within a document to monitor.</p> <p></p> <p>For instant triggers, we can optionally specify a \u201creadiness\u201d column. If we leave this blank, anytime a record is created or changed in the selected table, Grist will notify Zapier about it. If we set it, it should generally be to a toggle column, and Grist will notify Zapier only for records when that column is turned on. That is handy for records that have many columns being filled in manually, when we don\u2019t want to trigger until they are complete. For this example, it is fine to leave the readiness column blank. (For regular non-instant triggers, we would need to pick a specific column to monitor. Ideally this would be an <code>Updated At</code> column, see Timestamp columns).</p> <p>On the Gmail side, we can email to pre-set addresses, or this could be configured dynamically (we\u2019ll see an example of how in a moment):</p> <p></p> <p>We choose to set the body of the email to contain \u201cCustom\u201d content, in this case the <code>Text</code> cell we calculated earlier.</p> <p></p> <p>And we\u2019re done!  Zapier will offer to make a quick test that emails go out correctly:</p> <p></p> <p>Then you can make some votes and watch the system work.  For instant triggers, results should show up fairly snappily.  Otherwise, Zapier has a \u201crun zap\u201d functionality to force an integration to update immediately:</p> <p></p> <p>And emails should start showing up in the desired inboxes.

If you summarize by \u201ccategory_code\u201d, you\u2019ll get a row for each distinct value of \u201ccategory_code\u201d. Let\u2019s do that and then click \u201cAdd Page\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>This is similar to Excel\u2019s pivot tables. Each row represents the group of records from the source table (\u201cCompanies\u201d) that have a particular value of \u201ccategory_code\u201d. There is a reminder of that in the table\u2019s title (\u201cCOMPANIES [by category_code]\u201d).</p> <p>Such summary tables can (and should!) use formulas. The columns you choose when creating the table are the identifiers of the groups. All other columns are formula columns \u2013 they are calculated. In formulas, the group of source records summarized by one row is available as the value \u201c$group\u201d.</p> <p>For example, you\u2019ll see a column created automatically called \u201ccount\u201d. If you hit \u201cEnter\u201d, you\u2019ll see the formula in it \u2013 <code>len($group)</code> \u2013 that\u2019s just the number of records in that group of records, i.e. the number of companies in that category.</p> <p></p> <p>For numeric columns in the source table, summary tables automatically get a same-named numeric column containing a sum, with a formula such as <code>SUM($group.funding_total_usd)</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>A note for Python fans</p> <p><code>$group</code> is a special Python object. It\u2019s an iterable collection of records. Using an attribute like <code>$group.A</code> is a shorthand for the list of values in the <code>A</code> column of all the records in the group, i.e. it\u2019s roughly equivalent to <code>[r.A for r in $group]</code>.</p> <p>Sometimes, adding the values doesn\u2019t make sense. E.g. the sum of \u201cfounded_year\u201d is meaningless. It\u2019s best to delete this and any other column we don\u2019t need, which leaves us with the \u201cfunding_total_usd\u201d column.</p> <p>Since this column contains large numbers, it\u2019s a good time to look at the \u201cNumber Format\u201d section of its configuration, and click <code>,</code> (or perhaps <code>$</code>) to format numbers to be more readable.</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s add a second summary table. Select \u201cAdd New\u201d again to \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. To get a summary by year, select the \u201cInvestments\u201d table under \u201cSelect Data\u201d, and again use its sum symbol (\u2211) to select the column by which to summarize: \u201cfunded_year\u201d and then click \u201cAdd to page\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>This produces a second summary table that shows a record for each year, with each representing a group of \u201cInvestments\u201d rows for that year. The most useful column is \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d, adding all investments made in that year. Let\u2019s delete the unneeded columns.</p> <p>You\u2019ll notice pink values in \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d. That\u2019s because Grist guesses the column type to be an integer.The pink sums are instances where the numbers exceed Javascript\u2019s ability to handle large integers. To correct for this, the type of the column should be switched to \u201cNumeric\u201d (which trades off precision for the ability to represent very large and very small numbers). Change the type to \u201cNumeric\u201c under \u201cColumn options\u201d.</p> <p>This is again a good time to pick a friendlier number format for the column, and to make it wider to fit the longer numbers.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"investment-research/#chart-graph-plot","title":"Chart, graph, plot","text":"<p>You can make a chart of any data.

In the widget picker, click the summation icon () next to the table you\u2019d like to summarize.</p> <p></p> <p>When creating a summary table, you choose a field or a combination of fields by which data should be grouped. These are called the \u201cGroup by\u201d fields. The summary table will contain one row for each group-by value. For instance, if \u201cPosition\u201d is selected as a group-by field, the summary table will contain one row for each job position.</p> <p>Grist\u2019s powerful formulas then allow arbitrary calculations on the matching subsets of the underlying data.</p> <p>Keep in mind that the group-by fields determine which groups should exist in the summary table. Do not select values you\u2019d like to calculate (e.g. for average salary) as group-by fields; these will be created using formulas in the next step.</p> <p>Tip: You can think of rows in a summary table as buckets into which your records will be placed. Group-by fields determine the labels for these buckets. For instance, a summary of projects grouped by status (e.g. \u201cActive\u201d, \u201cCompleted\u201d, \u201cNotStarted\u201d) will have three such buckets, one for each status. Every project goes into one of these three buckets. You can then easily calculate info for each folder, such as a count of projects or the total of their costs.</p>"},{"location":"summary-tables/#summary-formulas","title":"Summary formulas","text":"<p>When you add a summary table, each of the selected group-by fields becomes a column in the new table. Everything else in the summary table is calculated using formula columns. Some of these columns are created automatically, as a convenience.</p> <p>Specifically, a column <code>count</code> will be added to show the number of records in the group represented by the current summary row. And for any numerical column in the original data, the summary table will contain a same-named column with the total. For instance, the summary of Employees grouped by Position would look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Tip: A summary widget will have a header like \u201cEMPLOYEES [by Position]\u201d, to indicate that it\u2019s showing summary data for the <code>Employees</code> table, grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d. You can click the title to rename it.</p> <p>If you select a cell in a column like <code>count</code> or <code>AnnualPay</code> and hit <code>Enter</code>, you\u2019ll see the formulas that calculate them:</p> <ul> <li><code>count</code> is <code>len($group)</code></li> <li><code>AnnualPay</code> is <code>SUM($group.AnnualPay)</code></li> </ul> <p>The mysterious <code>$group</code> is simply another column, hidden by default (but you may unhide it). It contains for each cell the group of records represented by this summary row.</p> <p>Side note for Python fans. <code>$group</code> is a special Python object. It\u2019s an iterable collection of records. Using an attribute like <code>$group.A</code> is a shorthand for the list of values in the <code>A</code> column of all the records in the group, similar to <code>[r.A for r in $group]</code>.</p> <p>If you unhide this column, it will show as a python list of numeric row IDs which identify the records in the group.</p> <p>Sometimes the automatically created columns don\u2019t make sense. For instance, the sum of <code>PayRate</code> isn\u2019t very meaningful. Simply delete such columns, either using the column menu or using the <code>Alt + Minus</code> keyboard shortcut.</p> <p>You are free to change formulas for the automatically created columns, or to add new formula columns. Note that summary tables do not allow adding non-formula columns.</p> <p>For instance, you might want to change the formula for <code>PayRate</code> from <code>SUM($group.PayRate)</code> to <code>AVERAGE($group.PayRate)</code>, which would be a more interesting value.</p> <p></p> <p>Here are some useful recipes of formulas in summary tables:</p> <ul> <li>Average: <code>AVERAGE($group.PayRate)</code> or <code>SUM($group.PayRate) / $count</code></li> <li>Standard deviation: <code>STDEV($group.PayRate)</code></li> <li>Maximum or minimum: <code>MAX($group.PayRate)</code>, <code>MIN($group.PayRate)</code></li> <li>Sum over a subset of records: <code>SUM(r.AnnualPay for r in $group if r.EmploymentStatus == \"Active\")</code></li> <li>Weighted average: <code>AVERAGE_WEIGHTED(zip($group.Life_Expectancy, $group.Population))</code></li> </ul> <p>In fact, you may use the full power of Python to calculate what you\u2019d like.

Let\u2019s say you want to associate some data with each position, such as a job description, or a workers compensation insurance code. Such data belongs in its own table, with one row for each position, and a few columns.</p> <p>Summary tables provide an easy way to create such a table. Add a page with a summary of <code>Employees</code> grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, in the right panel\u2019s \u201cData\u201d tab, click the \u201cDetach\u201d button.</p> <p></p> <p>Your summary table just got turned into a brand new table with the same rows and an auto-generated name, like \u201cTable1\u201d.

You can also use this widget in any other table or share with a friend, as it doesn\u2019t depend on your table structure and can be easily configured.</p> <p>In the configuration used above, we told Grist that all the columns are required, and the user can pick any column even if the column doesn\u2019t contain a text value. To be more precise, we can include more options in the request. For example:</p> <pre><code>grist.ready({columns: [\n  {\n    name: \"Link\", // What field we will read.\n    title: \"Image link\", // Friendly field name.\n    optional: false, // Is this an optional field.\n    type: \"Text\" // What type of column we expect.\n    description: \"Some text\" // Description of a field.\n    allowMultiple: false // Allows multiple column assignment.\n  }\n]});\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>optional</code> setting is important for correct operation of the <code>mapColumnNames</code> helper. This helper will return a mapped record only when all required (not optional) columns are picked.</p> <p>By default Grist will allow the user to pick any type of column. To allow only a column of a specific type, you need to set a <code>type</code> property. Here are all valid types:</p> <p><code>Int</code> (Integer column), <code>Numeric</code> (Numeric column), <code>Text</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>DateTime</code>, <code>Bool</code> (Toggle column), <code>Choice</code>, <code>ChoiceList</code>, <code>Ref</code> (Reference column), <code>RefList</code> (Reference List), <code>Attachments</code>.</p> <p>The default value of <code>type</code> is <code>Any</code>, so Grist will allow the user to pick any column type. You can also specify a list of types, for example <code>Date,DateTime</code>. In that case, Grist will allow the user to pick any column that matches one of the types in the list.</p> <p>Use <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> fields to help your users understand what is the purpose of the column. The <code>description</code> will be displayed just below the column name, and the <code>title</code> will be used as a column label. Both are optional and you can put there any text you want.</p> <p>If you need to map multiple columns (for example in a custom chart widget), you can use <code>allowMultiple</code> option. This will allow your users to pick a set of columns that will be returned as list of mapped table column names.

Here are some JavaScript code snippets that show how to interact with this API:</p> <pre><code>// Store a simple text value .\nawait grist.setOption('color', '#FF0000');\n\n// Store complex objects as JSON.\nawait grist.setOption('settings', {lines: 10, skipFirst: true});\n\n// Read previously saved option\nconst color = await grist.getOption('color');\n\n// Clear all options.\nawait grist.clearOptions();\n\n// Get and replace all options.\nawait grist.getOptions();\nawait grist.setOptions({...});\n</code></pre> <p>You can experiment with this yourself. Here is a test widget that demonstrates how to use this API:</p> <p>https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/inspect/onOptions.html</p> <p>When your widget saves or edits some options, the icon on top of the section gets highlighted in green. You can either apply those options to the widget or revert that modification.</p> <p></p> <p>This allows viewers (users with read-only access) or collaborators to configure your widget without overwriting original settings. This behavior should look familiar to you and others, as this works like sorting and filtering on table or card views.</p> <p>Saving current options you will apply them to the widget and make them available to others. Using this menu, you can also clear all options to revert the widget to its initial state. To do this, press the little trash icon and then <code>Save</code>.</p> <p>Grist will also trigger an event, every time the options are changed (or cleared). Here is how you can subscribe to this event.</p> <pre><code>grist.onOptions(function(options, interaction) {\n  if (options) {\n    console.log('Current color', options.color);\n  } else {\n    // No widget options were saved, fallback to default ones.\n  }\n});\n</code></pre> <p>If you are building your own widget, you generally should not read options directly (using <code>grist.widgetApi.getOption()</code>). A better pattern is to apply them all when they are changed. Using the <code>onOptions</code> handler will make your widget easier to change and understand later.</p> <p>There is one more scenario to cover. Suppose your widget has some kind of custom configuration screen. In that case, you probably need some button or other UI element that the user can use to show it. This additional UI element will likely be rarely used by you or your collaborators, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to show it all the time. To help with this, Grist offers an additional interaction option you can send as part of the ready message:</p> <pre><code>grist.ready({\n  onEditOptions: function() {\n    // Your custom logic to open the custom configuration screen.\n  }\n});\n</code></pre> <p>This will tell Grist to display an additional button <code>Open configuration</code> in the creator panel and the section menu.

Otherwise, returns the record at the current cursor position in a widget linked to the notebook widget.</li> <li><code>async fetch_table(table_id)</code>: returns the data of the specified table. Note that this differs from <code>fetch_selected_table</code> (even for the same table) in several ways:<ul> <li>The widget must have full document access.</li> <li>All columns are included, whereas <code>fetch_selected_table</code> excludes columns that are hidden in the widget configuration.</li> <li>All rows are included, whereas <code>fetch_selected_table</code> takes widget filters and \u2018SELECT BY\u2019 into account.</li> <li>The data is not sorted according to the widget\u2019s configuration.</li> <li>The data is fetched from the server, so the method may be slower.</li> <li>The values for reference columns are row IDs of the referenced table, whereas <code>fetch_selected_table</code> returns the values displayed based on the \u2018SHOW COLUMN\u2019 configuration.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>on_record(callback)</code>: registers a callback function to run when the cursor moves in a widget linked to the notebook widget, i.e. the widget chosen from the \u201cSELECT BY\u201d dropdown in the Data section of the widget configuration. The callback function will be passed the record at the current cursor position. You can also use this as a decorator, i.e. <code>@grist.on_record</code>.</li> <li><code>on_records(callback)</code>: similar to <code>on_record</code>, but runs when the source data of the widget changes. The callback function will be passed the same data as returned by <code>fetch_selected_table</code>.</li> <li><code>get_table(table_id)</code>: returns a <code>TableOperations</code> class similar to the interface in the usual JS plugin API for performing CRUD-style operations on a table. See the plugin API documentation for details on the parameters. The class has the following methods:<ul> <li><code>async create(records, parse_strings=True)</code></li> <li><code>async update(records, parse_strings=True)</code></li> <li><code>async upsert(records, parse_strings=True, add=True, update=True, on_many=\"first\", allow_empty_require=False)</code></li> <li><code>async destroy(row_ids)</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>You can also use <code>grist.raw</code> for direct access to the plugin API, e.g. <code>await grist.raw.docApi.fetchTable(table_id)</code>.

There are all sorts of possible styles of invoice, so Grist lets web developers create their own using Custom Widgets.  We\u2019ll use an example invoice style published by Grist, but if it doesn\u2019t match your needs any web developer could tweak it for you.</p> <p>Click on <code>Add New</code>, then <code>Add Widget to Page</code>.

This grants the Custom Widget access to read the Invoices table.</p> <p></p> <p>Now place anything you like in a row of the Invoices table (I just added the number <code>1</code>). An incomplete invoice will immediately show up:</p> <p></p> <p>The incomplete invoice shows what column names to use to control what parts of the invoice.  An extra black box shows what columns the widget understands, what columns it is ignoring, and what extra columns the widget could make use of.

So let\u2019s rename the <code>A</code> column to <code>Number</code>, we could leave the value as 1, but then it looks like we haven\u2019t done much business yet.  I\u2019m going to choose the set the invoice number to be <code>$id + 51371</code>, where <code>$id</code> is an auto-incrementing numeric identifier assigned to each row. But you could set it manually or with a different formula.  As soon as it is set, the invoice updates:</p> <p></p> <p>The next column the help box suggests is <code>Client</code>, so let\u2019s rename the <code>B</code> column to <code>Client</code>.  Later we will give client information in a structured way, but for now let\u2019s just put some text here (use <code>Shift + Enter</code> to insert line breaks):</p> <p></p> <p>Great, now the Client box is filled out.  The next suggested column is <code>Items</code>, so let\u2019s rename the <code>C</code> column to <code>Items</code>.  Later we will give item information in a structured way, but for now let\u2019s just put some text here:</p> <p></p> <p>And now the Description is set.

In the example, it is simply <code>\", \".join([$City, $State])</code>.  The <code>GeocodedAddress</code> should be left untouched; it is a space for the geocoder to store information. Finally, <code>Geocode</code> is a toggle that should be turned on to automatically generate latitude and longitudes.</p> <p></p> <p>The geocoder will not touch any rows with <code>Geocode</code> turned off.  When <code>Geocode</code> is turned on for a row, latitudes and longitudes are computed and stored automatically for that row using Nominatim.

You can now use getgrist.com as an authentication provider, which is the simplest way to set up authentication.

Authentication via getgrist.com is free and your documents and data stay on your server, as always. To set this up, check out our updated documentation.</p> <p>Note: this feature works for Grist with a single team site (<code>GRIST_SINGLE_ORG</code> set to your team site).
