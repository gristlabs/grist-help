L\u2019entreprise est g\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un document avec deux tables, Orders (commandes) et Financials (finances).

Default rules # To see the access rules for a document, visit its access rules page by clicking Access Rules in the left sidebar. When no custom rules have been created yet, the access rules page contains the Default Rules for our document: These rules say, in summary, that Owners and Editors can do anything within the document, that Viewers can only read the document, and everyone else is forbidden all access. These rules cannot be modified, but they can be overridden. To understand whether a group of rules allows a certain permission ( Read, Update, Create, Delete, or Structure ), read the rules from top to bottom, and find the first applicable rule that allows (green) or denies (red) that permission. We\u2019ll see plenty of examples as we go. Lock down structure # By default Owners and Editors are equally powerful within a document, with the ability to create or delete tables or columns, write formulas, reorganize pages, and so on. Suppose we want only the original Owners of the document to be allowed to change its structure, as we plan to invite other specialized collaborators as Editors. To do this, uncheck the box for the first rule listed under \u2018Special Rules\u2019 to disallow editors from editing structure. Once we\u2019ve made changes, the SAVE button becomes an inviting green. We click SAVE for the rule to take effect. Important. This is an important first step for any document where you intend to block any access to Editors. Without denying them the structure permission ( S ), anyone with edit access will be able to create or change formulas. Since formula calculations are not limited by access control rules, a determined user could use them to retrieve any data from a document. To protect against that, deny structure permission to users whose access should be limited. Make a private table # To ensure that only Owners can access a table, such as the Financials table in our example, we click Add Table Rules and select the table name, Financials . This creates a new empty group of rules called Rules for table Financials . Then we add a condition for any user who is not an Owner ( user.Access != OWNER ), with all permissions denied. Selecting Deny All from the drop-down beside R U C D is a fast way to set all permissions to denied, or you can click each permission individually to turn them red. R is Read, U is Update, C is Create, and D is Delete (see Access rule permissions ). Structure ( S ) permissions are not available at the table level. Once you are done, click SAVE . Now we could go ahead and share the document with a team member specialized in deliveries, for example. We share the document with them as an Editor so that the restrictions we\u2019ve set up apply to them. They won\u2019t see the Financials table in the left side bar, and attempts to open it will be denied: Seed Rules # When writing access rules for specific tables, it is fairly common to repeat the same rule across many tables \u2014 for example, always grant owners full read and write permissions. To automatically add a set of rules to all new table rules, you can write \u201cseed rules.\u201d There is a checkbox above default rules that makes the common case easier with one click. Click it to write a seed rule that will automatically grant owners full access whenever table rules are added. Click the > icon to uncollapse the seed rules table to modify seed rules. Restrict access to columns # We can restrict a collaborator\u2019s access to columns. In our eample, we might wish to give a delivery specialist more limited access to the Orders table. Perhaps they don\u2019t need to see an Email column, or a Piece column with details of what is in the parcel. Click Add Table Rules and select Orders to create a rule group for the Orders table. Now, in the Rules for table Orders group, click the three-dot icon (\u2026), and select Add Column Rule : In the Columns area we have a new [Add Column] dropdown to add all the columns to which we want the rule to apply (in our case Email and Piece ). For the condition, we could use user.Email == 'kiwi@getgrist.com' . This checks for the email address of Kimberly, our fictional delivery specialist; we could also check by name or a numeric ID. We turn all available permissions off for this user on these columns: Now that the rules are ready, click Save . If we have another employee who specializes in sourcing objects, and who needs to see a different set of columns, we can do that. For example here we add a rule to withhold Address and Phone columns from user Charon : View as another user # A convenient way to check if access rules work as expected is with the View As feature, available in the View As dropdown. This allows an Owner to open the document as if they were one of the people it is shared with, to see what their colleague would see. The Owner does not \u201cbecome\u201d that colleague - any changes they make will be recorded as coming from themselves and not the colleague - but they do see the document from the colleague\u2019s perspective. In our example, we could select Kiwi, and the document reopens, with a large banner stating that we are viewing it as Kiwi. The Piece and Email columns are missing, and the Financials table is surpressed: You can also check in Raw Data to confirm only the expected tables, columns, and rows are exposed. When satisfied that everything looks as expected, we click the green View as Yourself button to close this preview, and the document will reload. User attribute tables # If we are successful and hire many sourcing and delivery people, then adding them one by one to rules would be tedious. One solution is to use \u201cuser attribute tables.\u201d You can add a table to your document that classifies users as you like, and then use those classes in your access rules. For example, we can make a table called Team , and give it two columns, Email and Role , where Role is a choice between Sourcing and Delivery . Now we can tell Grist to make information from this table available for access rules, by clicking on Add User Attributes . Give the attribute any name you like (this will be how we refer to it in formulas), such as Team . Pick the table to read ( Team also in this case). Give a user property to match against rows in this table - in our case we\u2019ll use user.Email . And the column to match against, Email . Save that. Now we can update our rules to be more general. We find with autocomplete that we have a new user.Team variable available in condtions. It makes columns from the Team available, such as user.Team.Role . Now we can check if the user has a particular role, and apply the permissions that go with that: Great! Doing a spot check, Charon sees the expected columns for someone in Sourcing. And if we recruit someone else to work with them, we can just add them in the Team table, no rule changes needed. Row-level access control # In our example, as orders are processed, they move from sourcing to delivery phases. So there\u2019s really no need for the two groups to see all the orders at once. Let\u2019s add a column called Stage that can be set to Sourcing or Delivery , so that we can update access rules to show only the relevant orders. In the Rules for table Orders group, click the three-dot icon (\u2026), and select Add Default Rule to add a rule that isn\u2019t limited to specific columns. Let\u2019s deny access to all rows for non-Owners as a starting point, then add back in the ones we want. We can do that with the condition user.Access != OWNER with Deny All permissions. Then, we add another default rule by clicking + , and add the condition user.Team.Role == rec.Stage . The rec variable allows us to express rules that depend on the content within a particular record. Here, we check if the Stage column of a record matches the user\u2019s role. If it is, we allow R Read access: Here\u2019s how the table looks now as Kimberly (doing deliveries): And here\u2019s how the table looks as Charon (doing sourcing): Kimberly and Charon now have read-only access to the table. Owners still have full write access to all rows and columns. !!! note \u201cUnderstanding reference columns in access rules\u201d You can limit the data team members access to just those rows pertinent to their work. One way to do so is to relate all records in all tables to their respective team members. For example, leads and sales records can reference the sales rep responsible for those records. This quick video explains how. <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZL3rHdAZzfY?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Checking new values # Access rules can be used to permit only certain changes to the document. Suppose we want Delivery people to be able to change Stage from Delivery to Done , without giving them the arbitrary rights to edit that column. We can grant them that exceptional right as follows. In the Rules for table Orders group, click the three-dot icon (\u2026), and select Add Column Rule . Set [Add Column] to Stage , and mark the U/Update permission to be granted. For the condition, use this: (user.Team.Role == 'Delivery' and rec.Stage == 'Delivery' and newRec.Stage == 'Done') This checks if the user has the Delivery role, and the record is in the Delivery stage, and that the user is trying to change the Stage to Done . The newRec variable is a variant of rec available when the user is proposing to change a record, with rec containing its state before the change, and newRec its state after the proposed change. Now, if we view the table as Kiwi, and try to change a Stage to Sourcing , we are denied: If we change a Stage to Done , it works, and the record disappears from view since it is no longer in the Delivery stage: Link keys # Sometimes it is useful to give access to a specific small slice of the document, for example a single row of a table. Grist offers a feature called \u201clink keys\u201d that can help with that. Any parameters in a Grist document URL that end in an underscore are made available to access rules in a user.LinkKey variable. So for example if a document URL ends in ....?Token_=xx-xx-xx-xx&Flavor_=vanilla , then user.LinkKey.Token will be set to xx-xx-xx-xx and user.LinkKey.Flavor to vanilla . Let\u2019s work through an example to see how that can be helpful. Suppose we have a table of Orders and we\u2019d like to occasionally share information about a single order with someone. To do that with link keys, we need some kind of hard-to-guess code for each order, which can be used to access it. Grist has a UUID() function that gives a unique, random, and hard-to-guess identifier, so let\u2019s add a UUID column with formula =UUID() : In fact we want UUID() to be called just once per order, when we create it, and never recomputed (because then it would change). So in the right sidebar we convert the formula column to a data column, freezing its values: This converts our formula to a trigger formula. We set the formula to apply to new records: At this point we have a solid hard-to-guess code for each order in the UUID column, that will be created as we add new orders. It can be handy at this point to construct links to the document with that code embedded in them. Grist has a helper for this called SELF_HYPERLINK . To add a link key called <NAME> , just use this function with a LinkKey_<NAME> argument. In our case, we pass LinkKey_UUID=$UUID to embed the value of the UUID column into the URL. We also set label=$Ref to control the text label of the link in the spreadsheet. To show the link, we set the column type to Text and set the HyperLink option: Once we have these links, we can tidy up a little by hiding the UUID and Ref columns (see Column operations for a refresher on how to do this): The links don\u2019t do anything special yet, but we have everything we need to make that happen now. Here is an example of access rules to allow anyone with a UUID in their URL to read any order with a matching UUID (otherwise only owners can read orders in this case): And here is what a non-owner now sees, with the UUID of the first order in their URL: This is just the beginning of the possibilities. Link keys can give access to multiple rows across many tables. They can be used in User attribute tables . And the data they give access to can be within tables, cards, card lists, charts, and custom widgets. Check out another example to deepen your understanding of link keys even more. Access rule conditions # Accress rule conditions contain a formula expressing when the rule should apply. A blank condition will always apply. When a condition applies for an action, the permissions associated with the condition are set to allowed or denied for that action if no earlier rule in the same group has yet set them. When a condition does not apply, no permissions are set by that rule, but other rules could set them. Formulas are written in a restricted subset of Python. Variables that may be available in access rules are user , rec , and newRec . The user variable contains the following members: user.Access : one of owners , editors , or viewers , giving how the document was shared with the user (see Sharing a document ). user.Email : the email address of the user (or anon@getgrist.com for users who are not logged in). user.UserID : a numeric ID that is associated with the user. user.Name : the user\u2019s name (or Anonymous if unavailable). user.LinkKey : an object with any access control URL parameters. Access control URL parameters end in an underscore (which is then stripped). Only available in the web client, not the API. user.Origin : The content of the Origin request header. Only available in the API, not the web client. user.SessionID : a unique string assigned to anonymous users for the duration of that user\u2019s session. For logged in users, user.SessionID is always \"u\" the user\u2019s numeric id. For an example of using the user variable, read Default rules . The rec variable contains the state of an individual record/row, for conditions that need to take that into account. When it is used, that rule becomes row-specific. That allows, for example, to make certain rows visible only to certain users, or to prohibit modification of certain rows by certain users. For an example of using the rec variable, read Row-level access control . The newRec variable is available for record/row creation and updating, and contains the state of a row after a proposed change, allowing you to selectively allow or deny certain changes. For an example of using the newRec variable, read Checking new values . Supported operations in condition formalas are currently: and , or , + , - , * , / , % , == , != , < , <= , > , >= , is , is not , in , not in . Supported variables are: user , rec , newRec with their members accessed with . . Strings, numbers, and lists are also supported. If an operation you need is not available, consider whether you can do part of the work in a formula in the table itself (see Access rule memos for an example). Comments are allowed, using # or \"\"\" . If there is a comment in a rule, then the first comment in a rule that results in a denial of an action will be reported to the user as a tip for why the action was not permitted. See Access rule memos for an example. Access rule permissions # A permission controls whether a user can perform a particalar kind of action. Grist access rules currently deal with 5 kinds of action, which are given single letter acronyms for convenience: R - permission to read cells. U - permission to update cells. C - permission to create rows. D - permission to delete rows. S - permission to change table structure. The S structure permission is available in the default access rule group. Column rules lack the C create and D delete permissions, which should be handled in default table rules. Note: The S permission is very powerful. It allows writing formulas, which can access any data in the document regardless of rules. Since the S permission is on by default for Editors and Owners, any such user would be able to edit a formula and so retrieve any data. In other words, having the S permission makes it possible to circumvent other rules that prevent access to data. For this reason, turning it off \u2013 as described above in Locking down structure \u2013 is an important first step in limiting data access. Access rule memos # When a user receives an error message denying them access because of a rule, it can be helpful to give specific details that will help them understand the problem. You can do this by adding a memo for the condition. First, click the memo icon to the right of your condition. Type the error message you wish to display into the entry box. Be sure to save your changes. When the rule blocks a user from performing an action, the memo will appear as a notification. For an explanation of how this particular Access Rule works, see Access Rules to Restrict Duplicate Records Access rule examples # Along with the extended example of using access rules in this section, we will collect complete examples of access rule templates and guides here. Lead lists : A very simple list of leads, assigned to individuals to follow up, with control of assignments reserved for document owners. Account-based Sales Team : Sales CRM with deals and contacts assigned to sales reps. Reps can only see their own contacts and deals, but managers can see everything. Public Giveaway : A public giveaway organizer that uses access rules to enforce giveaway rules without requiring claimants to log into Grist. Simple Poll : A simple poll managed in Grist with access rules to limit one response per visitor. Crowdsourced List : Publicly crowdsourced list with access rules to empower moderators to edit almost anything, but limit visitors to only making and editing their own contributions. Time Sheets : Template to capture contractor timesheets. Access rules permit contractors to view only their historical time sheets, and edit only the active month. Project Management : Track tasks by event and flag tasks at risk. Access rules limit permissions by department, and expand managers\u2019 permissions.","title":"Intro to access rules"},{"location":"access-rules/#permissions-avancees","text":"Chaque document Grist peut \u00eatre partag\u00e9 avec d\u2019autres en utilisant l\u2019option \u00ab G\u00e9rer les utilisateurs \u00bb dans le menu Partager ( ).

Let\u2019s add a column called Stage that can be set to Sourcing or Delivery , so that we can update access rules to show only the relevant orders. In the Rules for table Orders group, click the three-dot icon (\u2026), and select Add Default Rule to add a rule that isn\u2019t limited to specific columns. Let\u2019s deny access to all rows for non-Owners as a starting point, then add back in the ones we want. We can do that with the condition user.Access != OWNER with Deny All permissions. Then, we add another default rule by clicking + , and add the condition user.Team.Role == rec.Stage . The rec variable allows us to express rules that depend on the content within a particular record. Here, we check if the Stage column of a record matches the user\u2019s role. If it is, we allow R Read access: Here\u2019s how the table looks now as Kimberly (doing deliveries): And here\u2019s how the table looks as Charon (doing sourcing): Kimberly and Charon now have read-only access to the table. Owners still have full write access to all rows and columns. !!! note \u201cUnderstanding reference columns in access rules\u201d You can limit the data team members access to just those rows pertinent to their work. One way to do so is to relate all records in all tables to their respective team members. For example, leads and sales records can reference the sales rep responsible for those records.

The newRec variable is a variant of rec available when the user is proposing to change a record, with rec containing its state before the change, and newRec its state after the proposed change. Now, if we view the table as Kiwi, and try to change a Stage to Sourcing , we are denied: If we change a Stage to Done , it works, and the record disappears from view since it is no longer in the Delivery stage:","title":"Checking new values"},{"location":"access-rules/#link-keys","text":"Sometimes it is useful to give access to a specific small slice of the document, for example a single row of a table. Grist offers a feature called \u201clink keys\u201d that can help with that. Any parameters in a Grist document URL that end in an underscore are made available to access rules in a user.LinkKey variable. So for example if a document URL ends in ....?Token_=xx-xx-xx-xx&Flavor_=vanilla , then user.LinkKey.Token will be set to xx-xx-xx-xx and user.LinkKey.Flavor to vanilla . Let\u2019s work through an example to see how that can be helpful. Suppose we have a table of Orders and we\u2019d like to occasionally share information about a single order with someone. To do that with link keys, we need some kind of hard-to-guess code for each order, which can be used to access it. Grist has a UUID() function that gives a unique, random, and hard-to-guess identifier, so let\u2019s add a UUID column with formula =UUID() : In fact we want UUID() to be called just once per order, when we create it, and never recomputed (because then it would change). So in the right sidebar we convert the formula column to a data column, freezing its values: This converts our formula to a trigger formula. We set the formula to apply to new records: At this point we have a solid hard-to-guess code for each order in the UUID column, that will be created as we add new orders. It can be handy at this point to construct links to the document with that code embedded in them. Grist has a helper for this called SELF_HYPERLINK . To add a link key called <NAME> , just use this function with a LinkKey_<NAME> argument. In our case, we pass LinkKey_UUID=$UUID to embed the value of the UUID column into the URL. We also set label=$Ref to control the text label of the link in the spreadsheet. To show the link, we set the column type to Text and set the HyperLink option: Once we have these links, we can tidy up a little by hiding the UUID and Ref columns (see Column operations for a refresher on how to do this): The links don\u2019t do anything special yet, but we have everything we need to make that happen now. Here is an example of access rules to allow anyone with a UUID in their URL to read any order with a matching UUID (otherwise only owners can read orders in this case): And here is what a non-owner now sees, with the UUID of the first order in their URL: This is just the beginning of the possibilities. Link keys can give access to multiple rows across many tables. They can be used in User attribute tables . And the data they give access to can be within tables, cards, card lists, charts, and custom widgets. Check out another example to deepen your understanding of link keys even more.","title":"Link keys"},{"location":"access-rules/#access-rule-conditions","text":"Accress rule conditions contain a formula expressing when the rule should apply. A blank condition will always apply. When a condition applies for an action, the permissions associated with the condition are set to allowed or denied for that action if no earlier rule in the same group has yet set them. When a condition does not apply, no permissions are set by that rule, but other rules could set them. Formulas are written in a restricted subset of Python. Variables that may be available in access rules are user , rec , and newRec . The user variable contains the following members: user.Access : one of owners , editors , or viewers , giving how the document was shared with the user (see Sharing a document ). user.Email : the email address of the user (or anon@getgrist.com for users who are not logged in). user.UserID : a numeric ID that is associated with the user. user.Name : the user\u2019s name (or Anonymous if unavailable). user.LinkKey : an object with any access control URL parameters. Access control URL parameters end in an underscore (which is then stripped). Only available in the web client, not the API. user.Origin : The content of the Origin request header. Only available in the API, not the web client. user.SessionID : a unique string assigned to anonymous users for the duration of that user\u2019s session. For logged in users, user.SessionID is always \"u\" the user\u2019s numeric id. For an example of using the user variable, read Default rules . The rec variable contains the state of an individual record/row, for conditions that need to take that into account. When it is used, that rule becomes row-specific. That allows, for example, to make certain rows visible only to certain users, or to prohibit modification of certain rows by certain users. For an example of using the rec variable, read Row-level access control . The newRec variable is available for record/row creation and updating, and contains the state of a row after a proposed change, allowing you to selectively allow or deny certain changes. For an example of using the newRec variable, read Checking new values . Supported operations in condition formalas are currently: and , or , + , - , * , / , % , == , != , < , <= , > , >= , is , is not , in , not in . Supported variables are: user , rec , newRec with their members accessed with . . Strings, numbers, and lists are also supported. If an operation you need is not available, consider whether you can do part of the work in a formula in the table itself (see Access rule memos for an example). Comments are allowed, using # or \"\"\" . If there is a comment in a rule, then the first comment in a rule that results in a denial of an action will be reported to the user as a tip for why the action was not permitted. See Access rule memos for an example.","title":"Access rule conditions"},{"location":"access-rules/#access-rule-permissions","text":"A permission controls whether a user can perform a particalar kind of action. Grist access rules currently deal with 5 kinds of action, which are given single letter acronyms for convenience: R - permission to read cells. U - permission to update cells. C - permission to create rows. D - permission to delete rows. S - permission to change table structure. The S structure permission is available in the default access rule group. Column rules lack the C create and D delete permissions, which should be handled in default table rules. Note: The S permission is very powerful. It allows writing formulas, which can access any data in the document regardless of rules. Since the S permission is on by default for Editors and Owners, any such user would be able to edit a formula and so retrieve any data. In other words, having the S permission makes it possible to circumvent other rules that prevent access to data.

The personal site is always named beginning with \u2018@\u2019 and is always located at docs.getgrist.com . Each document in this site may be shared with up to two guests for free. Learn more about free plans on our pricing page . Documents shared with you from other personal accounts will be shown in your personal site in workspaces named with \u2018@Name\u2019 to indicate the owner of that document. You may navigate between your personal site and team sites by clicking in the top-left corner to open a drop-down menu of sites to which you have access. How to manage ownership of my team site? # Add a second owner Open the team site to which you want add a second owner. Click \u2018Manage Users\u2019 under the user menu by clicking on the profile icon in the top-right of Grist. Add the new email address as Owner, and click Confirm. You may also wish to go to \u2018Billing Account\u2019 (also under the user menu) and add the new owner as a Billing Manager. Transfer ownership Follow steps 1-3 above to add a second owner. Go to \u2018Billing Account\u2019 (also under the user menu) and add the new Owner as a Billing Manager . The new Owner should log in, open the team site, and visit \u2018Manage Users\u2019 and \u2018Billing Account\u2019 pages again to remove the original owner. This will essentially transfer the ownership of the team site to the new account. It is not possible to add a second owner to, or transfer ownership of, a personal account . Did you know? If you\u2019re transferring team site ownership between two Grist email accounts that you own, you can more easily transfer ownership by signing in with multiple accounts. To sign in with another account, open the user menu and click on \u2018Add Account\u2019. You can now easily switch between all your accounts, and all your teams, from the user menu. Follow the steps above to transfer ownership from one account to the other. Can I edit my team\u2019s name and subdomain? # You may edit your site name and subdomain from the billing page. Open the user menu by clicking on the profile icon in the top-right of Grist, then click on \u2018Billing Account\u2019 . Documents and data # Can I move documents between sites? # Yes! Follow these steps to move documents between sites. Open the document you wish to move and click on the share icon ( ), then click \u2018Duplicate Document\u2019 in the menu. Select the site (organization) to which you want to transfer the document. This will create a copy, so you\u2019ll still have the original document in your original site. You can always delete it. Learn more about copying documents . How many rows can I have? # As a rule of thumb, Grist works best for documents under 100,000 rows. The actual limit depends also on the number of tables, columns, and the average size of data in each cell. One way to estimate it is to measure the size of the data when it is in CSV format: the limit is around 20MB in this format. For example, a document with 200,000 rows and 12 numeric columns would reach that. Attachments are counted separately. Attachments plus data in a single document are limited to 1GB. Learn more about limits . Does Grist accept non-English characters? # Non-English characters are supported in column labels, but not column ids, which are the column\u2019s Python name used in formulas. When importing a file into Grist, non-English characters do import as values in cells, but do not import into column labels (aka headers). The column labels are approximated with English characters. You may rename the column labels to include non-English characters after import. To edit column labels and ids separately, open the creator panel and select the column menu. Click the link icon that joins label to id to enable column id editing. While non-English characters are not supported, it is possible to edit the ids into something more clear and friendly to use in formulas. How do I sum the total of a column? # To summarize multiple records, you need summary tables . The major difference between Grist and spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets is that Grist is a database, so each row in a grid represents a record (e.g. a person, a bank transaction, etc.) Since a sum across multiple records isn\u2019t the same kind of record, Grist offers summarizing data as a separate widget, which can be modified to calculate even more powerful summary data. For example, suppose you have a table of webstore orders called Orders and you want to sum sales revenue from all orders. At the top of the left-side menu, click \u2018Add New\u2019 button and select \u2018Add Page\u2019 or \u2018Add Widget to Page\u2019. In the widget picker, select the Orders table then click the summation icon ( ) next to it. Add the page or widget to your document. Done! You\u2019ve now created a summary table that by default counts all the records in the Orders table, and sums all numeric and integer columns, such as the amount sold in each order. Summary tables can do more than a sum of a tables\u2019 columns. With just a few clicks you can summarize orders by month to calculate the number of orders and total sales revenue in each month for which you have data. Take it a step further and suppose you have multiple webstores. With Grist, you can record all sales orders across all stores and months in the same table. Then, you can summarize by month and webstore. When you add more months (or stores!) to the orders table, the summary table will automatically update, which is another key difference with spreadsheets. In Excel, you would need to expand your formula\u2019s range, or add more sheets and modify formulas everytime you added more sales orders, months, or stores. In Grist, you create the summary table once, and let Grist do the future work for you. In addition to our summary tables article, we have a video tutorial and follow-along guide that provides an example in building a dashboard with summary tables. Sharing # What\u2019s the difference between a team member and a guest? # Team members all have access to a team site , which is located at a url with a custom subdomain, such as your-team.getgrist.com . On paid plans, the number of team members determines the price. By default, documents within a team site may be accessed by all team members. This default can be modified to only share certain documents or certain workspaces with specific team members. Guests, on the other hand, are invited to particular documents, but are not added to your team. All documents in Grist, including those on personal sites, are allowed up to 2 free guests, and do not affect the plan price. Can I only share Grist documents with my team? # There are many ways to share Grist data with non-team members. Guests. Each document may be shared with 2 guests (non-team members) at no additional cost. Link sharing. In share settings, there is an option to turn on public access . The public access role can be set to viewer or editor. Anyone with a link can view (or edit) your data. Those views would not count towards your plan\u2019s user count.

The major difference between Grist and spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets is that Grist is a database, so each row in a grid represents a record (e.g. a person, a bank transaction, etc.) Since a sum across multiple records isn\u2019t the same kind of record, Grist offers summarizing data as a separate widget, which can be modified to calculate even more powerful summary data. For example, suppose you have a table of webstore orders called Orders and you want to sum sales revenue from all orders. At the top of the left-side menu, click \u2018Add New\u2019 button and select \u2018Add Page\u2019 or \u2018Add Widget to Page\u2019. In the widget picker, select the Orders table then click the summation icon ( ) next to it. Add the page or widget to your document. Done! You\u2019ve now created a summary table that by default counts all the records in the Orders table, and sums all numeric and integer columns, such as the amount sold in each order. Summary tables can do more than a sum of a tables\u2019 columns. With just a few clicks you can summarize orders by month to calculate the number of orders and total sales revenue in each month for which you have data. Take it a step further and suppose you have multiple webstores. With Grist, you can record all sales orders across all stores and months in the same table. Then, you can summarize by month and webstore. When you add more months (or stores!) to the orders table, the summary table will automatically update, which is another key difference with spreadsheets. In Excel, you would need to expand your formula\u2019s range, or add more sheets and modify formulas everytime you added more sales orders, months, or stores. In Grist, you create the summary table once, and let Grist do the future work for you. In addition to our summary tables article, we have a video tutorial and follow-along guide that provides an example in building a dashboard with summary tables.","title":"How do I sum the total of a column?"},{"location":"FAQ/#sharing","text":"","title":"Sharing"},{"location":"FAQ/#whats-the-difference-between-a-team-member-and-a-guest","text":"Team members all have access to a team site , which is located at a url with a custom subdomain, such as your-team.getgrist.com .

Grist is as easy to use as a spreadsheet, but gives you new powers when data doesn\u2019t fit in a simple grid. A good example is keeping track of contacts and our conversations with them. For a business, this could be customers, sales leads, or job candidates. For an individual, it could be companies they have applied to in a job search. In this tutorial, we\u2019ll explain the \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example, which you can use as a template for your own contacts, and then show how to build it from scratch. You\u2019ll learn how to: Add tables Link data Set column types Create custom layouts Exploring the example # Open the document Lightweight CRM , found in Examples & Templates in your Grist home page . You\u2019ll see the \u201cContacts\u201d page, listing contacts on the left of the screen. Click on any contact to select it. The two sections on the right show the details and the history of interactions with the selected contact. How does this compare to a spreadsheet? These screenshots show the Lightweight CRM example on the left, and a regular spreadsheet with the same data on the right. Previous Next Previous Next The difficulty is in the history of notes for a contact. In a two-dimensional grid, you have few options for where to include multiple notes. If you include them as multiple columns, it quickly makes the spreadsheet unwieldy and difficult to navigate. Grist feels more like an application, but it\u2019s still as versatile as a spreadsheet. The \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example can be used immediately as-is (with the sample data), or as a template (just the structure without the data). Here are a few more points on using it as a CRM: To add a new contact, click the blank row at the bottom of the contacts list, then fill in the blank \u201cCONTACTS Card\u201d section that shows on the right. To add a new conversation, select a contact, then click the blank line at the end of the Interactions table. You can enter today\u2019s date using the shortcut \u2318 + ; (semicolon) (Mac) or Ctrl + ; (semicolon) (Windows). Then select the type of interaction using auto-complete, and type in your notes. You can add To-Do items for a contact: in the Interactions list, select \u201cTo-Do\u201d in the \u201cType\u201d column as a special type of interaction. Think of the associated date as the due date for this task. The Contacts table shows the list of coming up To-Do items, sorted by their due date. If you use Gmail, the handy \u201cGmail search\u201d link in the \u201cCONTACTS Card\u201d section will open a browser window with the Gmail search results for this contact\u2019s email address. You can use this example as a template for your own contacts. With the \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example open, click the \u201cSave Copy\u201d button in in the top bar, then mark the \u201cAs Template\u201d checkbox. You\u2019ll get an empty document with the same layout, and can start filling it in with your own data. If you aren\u2019t signed in, you will need to sign in to make a copy of the example. Creating your own # The rest of this tutorial will show you how to create such a document on your own. It\u2019s a great exercise that will teach you some of the key features of Grist. To start, we\u2019ll import a file with sample contacts from the Grist home page. First, save this file to your desktop: lightweight-crm-contacts.csv . Then click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button on the top left of your Grist home page, click \u201cImport document\u201d, and select the file on your desktop. You\u2019ll see a table of contacts with sample data. Note that in Grist, columns have names. Rename this table to \u201cContacts\u201d by clicking its name in the top bar, and typing the new name. That\u2019s all you need for a simple table of contacts. You can add rows here, or add new columns to associate more data with each contact. Adding another table # For our next step, we want to be able to select a contact, and see the list of conversations with that contact. These conversations should be a new table of data. The cue is that it has a different number of rows from the table of contacts. Create the new table using the green \u201cAdd New\u201d button on the top left of your screen, and click \u201cAdd Empty Table\u201d in the menu. This table will represent interactions with our contacts, so let\u2019s rename it \u201cInteractions\u201d by clicking its default name (\u201cTable1\u201d) on top of the screen, as before. It\u2019s a good idea to give meaningful names to columns. In this case, for each interaction, we need to know which Contact it refers to, the date, type, and conversation notes. To rename a column, click its header to select the column, and click the header again to edit its name. You can hit the Tab key to continue to renaming the next column. Finally, hit the \u201c+\u201d button to the right of the last column to create one more column, and name it \u201cNotes\u201d. Linking data records # Every record in this table will belong to a particular contact. You set it up by turning the \u201cContact\u201d column into a reference to the table \u201cContacts\u201d. Using the triangle in the header of the column \u201cContact\u201d, open the menu and select \u201cColumn Options\u201d. In the right panel, use the \u201cColumn Type\u201d dropdown to select \u201cReference\u201d, then under \u201cData from table\u201d, select \u201cContacts\u201d. Each cell in this column will hold a pointer to a row in the \u201cContacts\u201d table 1 . While it refers to an entire row, it\u2019s useful to see some particular identifier of that row, so under \u201cShow column\u201d, select \u201cCompany\u201d. You\u2019ll see this in action shortly. Setting other types # In Grist, every column has a type. Often, the default of Text or Numeric is correct. For our \u201cDate\u201d column, a better type is Date. Click any cell in the \u201cDate\u201d column, and in the right panel, click into the \u201cColumn Type\u201d dropdown and select \u201cDate\u201d. If you\u2019d like, you can also choose a different date format right below the type. Now, if you click on a cell in the \u201cDate\u201d column and hit Enter, you have a convenient date picker. Another useful column type for us is \u201cChoice\u201d. Our interactions will be either \u201cPhone\u201d, \u201cEmail\u201d, or \u201cIn-person\u201d, and it\u2019s useful to list these options. Click into the \u201cType\u201d column, and in the right panel, set \u201cColumn Type\u201d to \u201cChoice\u201d. You\u2019ll see \u201cChoice Values\u201d textbox below. Click it, and enter your choices there, one per line: \u201cPhone\u201d, \u201cEmail\u201d, \u201cIn-person\u201d. Now, if you click on a cell in the \u201cType\u201d column and hit Enter, you can now choose from among the choices you set, or start typing and use auto-complete. Linking tables visually # The next step is to link the two tables visually. Open the \u201cContacts\u201d page, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button on top of the left panel, then \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. Select widget \u201cTable\u201d and data \u201cInteractions\u201d. In the \u201cSelect By\u201d dropdown at the bottom of the dialog, select \u201cCONTACTS\u201d. This means that choosing a contact will display only the interactions with that contact. Click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d to finish. Next, let\u2019s select a contact in the table on the left (let\u2019s use \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d in the fourth row) and add some notes for it. Type in a date (hint: the shortcut \u2318 + ; (semicolon) on Mac or Ctrl + ; (semicolon) on Windows inserts today\u2019s date), select a type, and enter a note. As soon as that row is created, the \u201cContact\u201d column is automatically filled with \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d, thanks to the sections being linked. The note we added is shown only when \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d is selected. We can add more notes for \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d, or add notes for any of the other contacts. We can now hide the \u201cContact\u201d column in the \u201cInteractions\u201d table: using the menu in the column\u2019s header, select \u201cHide Column\u201d. Because the tables are linked, we already see who the notes are for. For longer notes to be convenient, resize the \u201cNotes\u201d column by dragging the right edge of its header. To wrap long notes, open the Column Options, and click the line-wrapping icon. Customizing layout # Once you have multiple tables on one screen, the layout of the screen may become an issue. Having many columns in the Contacts table may no longer be convenient. It\u2019s better to lay it out like a custom application: select a contact from a list on the left and see that contact\u2019s details and interactions. This can be done by using \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d again. This time, we\u2019ll select the widget \u201cCard\u201d for the table \u201cContacts\u201d, and for \u201cSelect By\u201d will again use \u201cCONTACTS\u201d. You can move the resulting sections around to create a convenient layout. Move your mouse to the top left of each section until you see a \u201cdrag handle\u201d icon. Use that icon to drag each section into the desired spot relative to other sections. You can also resize sections by moving the mouse between them to find a dotted line. Drag this line to resize. Note how the same personal data is now shown in two places on the screen. These are not copies of data, but different presentations of the same data. Changing the data in one place will change it in the other. Customizing fields # At this point, we may do some cleanup: hide unneeded columns in the main \u201cContacts\u201d table and rearrange fields in the Card widget. A quick way to hide columns is using the right panel. Using the three-dot menu on the top right of the \u201cContacts\u201d table, select \u201cWidget options\u201d. In the panel that opens, find a list of \u201cVisible columns\u201d. Move the mouse over each column to reveal the \u201ceye\u201d icon. Click it to hide all columns except \u201cCompany\u201d. To customize the Card widget, click it. The right panel will show the relevant options. You can select a different Theme, e.g. \u201cCompact\u201d. To rearrange fields, click \u201cEdit Layout\u201d in the right panel. You can now drag-and-drop fields in the card, resize them, or remove them. Click \u201cSave\u201d once you are done. In a few short steps, we have gone from a clunky, unwieldy spreadsheet to a concise, elegant record of your interactions in a simple, effective custom application. To-Do Tasks for Contacts # The \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example has another trick up its sleeve. The \u201cType\u201d column in the interactions table has an extra choice, \u201cTo-Do\u201d. After you talk to a contact, you can add an extra note about what you need to do for the next conversation, and the date when it\u2019s due. The \u201cContacts\u201d table makes these To-Do items visible, and sortable by due date. This way you can see at a glance what\u2019s coming up next. If you are interested in the details of setting it up, expand the section below. For your first introduction to Grist, you are welcome to skip it. > Setting up To-Do tasks # To set up To-Do items as in the example, select Column Options for the \u201cType\u201d column in the Interactions table, and add another choice (\u201cTo-Do\u201d) to the list of choices: Let\u2019s pick our contact \u201cDouglas LLC\u201d and add a To-Do item: In the \u201cContacts\u201d table, add two new columns: Rename them to \u201cDue\u201d and \u201cTo-Do Items\u201d. Both columns are calculated using formulas. Grist has great support for formulas, allowing full Python syntax and many Excel functions. In Grist, a formula always applies to the entire column of data. To enter a formula, click on a cell in the \u201cDue\u201d column, and hit \u201c=\u201d key: In this formula, we want to look up all Interactions for the current Contact whose Type is \u201cTo-Do\u201d, then select the one with the earliest Date. Using Python syntax, the formula is: items = Interactions.lookupRecords(Contact=$id, Type=\"To-Do\") return min(items.Date) if items else None Paste it in, or type in. When typing in multi-line formulas, use Shift+Enter to add new lines, and Enter to save. It\u2019s also a good time to change the column type to \u201cDate\u201d. Open Column Options, and select \u201cDate\u201d for the type. You can choose the Date Format directly below the type. For the \u201cTo-Do Items\u201d, enter a formula similarly. In case of multiple To-Do items, this formula will concatenate them, separated by line breaks. Click into the \u201cTo-Do Items\u201d column, hit \u201c=\u201d to start typing the formula, and enter items = Interactions.lookupRecords(Contact=$id, Type=\"To-Do\") return \"\\n\".join(items.Notes) Now the To-Do item we entered earlier is visible in the main Contacts table. Note that the values in these columns are read-only, since they are calculated. To change the due date, find the To-Do item in the Interactions table where you created it. Sorting tables # We\u2019ll want contacts with To-Do items to show up first, in order of the Due date. Click the triangle in the header of the \u201cDue\u201d column, and select \u201cSort A-Z\u201d. By default, sorting settings are not saved. The highlighted green button in the top right of the \u201cContacts\u201d table reminds us of that. To keep this sort order when you reopen the document, save it by clicking that green button and selecting \u201cSave\u201d. You can also save by clicking the green check mark, to the right of the filter icon.

You\u2019ll see the \u201cContacts\u201d page, listing contacts on the left of the screen. Click on any contact to select it. The two sections on the right show the details and the history of interactions with the selected contact. How does this compare to a spreadsheet? These screenshots show the Lightweight CRM example on the left, and a regular spreadsheet with the same data on the right. Previous Next Previous Next The difficulty is in the history of notes for a contact. In a two-dimensional grid, you have few options for where to include multiple notes. If you include them as multiple columns, it quickly makes the spreadsheet unwieldy and difficult to navigate. Grist feels more like an application, but it\u2019s still as versatile as a spreadsheet. The \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example can be used immediately as-is (with the sample data), or as a template (just the structure without the data). Here are a few more points on using it as a CRM: To add a new contact, click the blank row at the bottom of the contacts list, then fill in the blank \u201cCONTACTS Card\u201d section that shows on the right. To add a new conversation, select a contact, then click the blank line at the end of the Interactions table. You can enter today\u2019s date using the shortcut \u2318 + ; (semicolon) (Mac) or Ctrl + ; (semicolon) (Windows). Then select the type of interaction using auto-complete, and type in your notes. You can add To-Do items for a contact: in the Interactions list, select \u201cTo-Do\u201d in the \u201cType\u201d column as a special type of interaction. Think of the associated date as the due date for this task. The Contacts table shows the list of coming up To-Do items, sorted by their due date. If you use Gmail, the handy \u201cGmail search\u201d link in the \u201cCONTACTS Card\u201d section will open a browser window with the Gmail search results for this contact\u2019s email address. You can use this example as a template for your own contacts. With the \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d example open, click the \u201cSave Copy\u201d button in in the top bar, then mark the \u201cAs Template\u201d checkbox.

First, save this file to your desktop: lightweight-crm-contacts.csv . Then click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button on the top left of your Grist home page, click \u201cImport document\u201d, and select the file on your desktop. You\u2019ll see a table of contacts with sample data. Note that in Grist, columns have names. Rename this table to \u201cContacts\u201d by clicking its name in the top bar, and typing the new name.

Mais la bonne nouvelle est que vous pouvez rejoindre la communaut\u00e9 de traduction pour nous aider \ud83d\udc4b . Grist offers several powerful ways to analyze and visualize data. In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to: Create summary tables Create and configure charts Link charts dynamically To explain these features, we\u2019ll use the sample document \u201cInvestment Research\u201d 1 which includes companies and investments in them up to 2013. Let\u2019s take a look at the sample document and then we\u2019ll talk about how to build it so that you can apply these tools to your own data. Exploring the example # Open the document \u201c Investment Research \u201d, found in Examples & Templates in your Grist home page. The first thing you\u2019ll see is \u201cOverview\u201d. This page contains two charts next to two tables. The top left has a pie chart showing the distribution of investments by category. The table next to it has the same data in tabular form. Below the pie chart is a bar graph showing the total investments raised by year. It is also accompanied by the same data in the table next to it in tabular form. All these charts and tables are examples of \u201csummary tables\u201d, which we\u2019ll describe below. The next page, \u201cBreakdowns\u201d, also contains two tables and two charts, but these are linked dynamically and offer much more detailed insight into the data. On the top left is a table showing the total funding by year (the same table as we saw on the previous page). This table serves as a driver for the chart next to it. When you click on a year in the table, the pie chart updates to show the distribution of investments in that year. Similarly, the bottom table shows investments by category. When you click on any category, the line chart next to it updates to show the history of funding in that category over the years. Note how powerful this is, and how much insight you can gain from it. For instance, you can see that Advertising category has been getting a lot of investment in NY since 2007, but was overtaken by E-commerce in 2013, while the Fashion category had a major spike in 2011. On the next page, \u201cCompany Details\u201d, we get to see the granular data of this dataset. Here, we see a list of companies and the categories they fall into. Each company shown has a link pointing to its listing on the Crunchbase website. Selecting a company shows a card with its details, as well as a list of all the investments it has received. This is where we begin to see the power of Grist. The original dataset is a flat spreadsheet of companies, and an even bigger spreadsheet of investments. By displaying the data graphically, the data comes alive, making it powerful and useful. How can I make this? # With Grist, presenting your own data in graphic form is a few easy steps away. Let\u2019s begin with the first step. Get the data # Let\u2019s import the raw data. We\u2019ll import two CSV files, where each will become its own table. To follow along, save the files from crunchbase_companies_ny.csv and crunchbase_investments_ny.csv to your computer first. Then, create a Grist document by importing the first file from the home page. Next, import the second table using the \u201cAdd New\u201d button and the \u201cImport from file\u201d option. In the import dialog box, finish by clicking \u201cImport\u201d on the bottom left. The tables you\u2019ve imported will be named \u201ccrunchbase_companies_ny\u201d and \u201ccrunchbase_investments_ny\u201d. Click the name at the top of the table to open the dialogue box and rename each of the tables to \u201cCompanies\u201d and \u201cInvestments\u201d. Make it relational # The power of Grist comes from giving structure to the data. Take a look at the \u201cInvestments\u201d table. Sort by the first column and you\u2019ll notice how much repetition there is: each row contains the complete company info, which both duplicates the data in the \u201cCompanies\u201d table, and is repeated multiple times when multiple investments apply to the same company. 2 The reality is that each investment applies to a single company. Each investment row only needs to contain a reference to a company, and the data specific to that investment. To make it so, find a column that identifies a company uniquely. In this dataset, the first column, \u201ccompany_permalink\u201d, does it best 3 . Click on the arrow in the column header and click \u201cColumn Options\u201d. Click on the arrow beside \u201cText\u201d under the \u201cColumn Type\u201d in the dialogue box at the right of the screen and select \u201cReference\u201d from the list. Grist will automatically suggest to make it a \u201cReference\u201d to the \u201cCompanies\u201d table, and to show the referenced company\u2019s \u201cpermalink\u201d. Click \u201cApply\u201d to save this conversion. Let\u2019s also rename this column to \u201cCompany\u201d. In Grist, duplicated data is not needed and we recommend removing it. Using the Option-Minus (Mac) or Alt-Minus (Windows) shortcut is a quick way to remove columns. After removing the columns from \u201ccompany_name\u201d to \u201ccompany_city\u201d, here\u2019s what\u2019s left: The data you\u2019ve deleted isn\u2019t lost since it was duplicated \u2013 it\u2019s still available in the \u201cCompanies\u201d table and can be used in an Investment record\u2019s formula as, e.g. $Company.company_xxx . In fact, there\u2019s a handy way to create this kind of formula. Let\u2019s create one that we\u2019ll need later. Click the header of the \u201cCompany\u201d column. In the right panel\u2019s Column tab, you\u2019ll see a section \u2018Add Referenced Columns\u2019. Click \u2018Add Column\u2019 to add the \u201ccategory_code\u201d column. A new column will be added to the table with the formula $Company.category_code . For each investment, it shows the \u201ccategory_code\u201d of the company linked to its investment record. Summarize # The powerful feature you\u2019ve been waiting for is the one that summarizes the data. Summary tables summarize each numeric column in a data table. We want to find the sum for the funding_total_usd column in the Companies table. Check that the column type is set to \u2018Numeric\u2019 and formatted with $ . To utilize this, let\u2019s add a table showing companies grouped by \u201ccategory_code\u201d. In the \u201cAdd New\u201d menu at the top left, select \u201cAdd Page\u201d. In the dialog box, select \u201cTable\u201d and \u201cCompanies\u201d, and then use the summation icon ( ) to select the \u201cGroup By\u201d columns \u2013 i.e. the columns by which to summarize. If you don\u2019t select any columns, you\u2019ll just get a single row of totals. If you summarize by \u201ccategory_code\u201d, you\u2019ll get a row for each distinct value of \u201ccategory_code\u201d. Let\u2019s do that and then click \u201cAdd Page\u201d. This is similar to Excel\u2019s pivot tables. Each row represents the group of records from the source table (\u201cCompanies\u201d) that have a particular value of \u201ccategory_code\u201d. There is a reminder of that in the table\u2019s title (\u201cCOMPANIES [by category_code]\u201d). Such summary tables can (and should!) use formulas. The columns you choose when creating the table are the identifiers of the groups. All other columns are formula columns \u2013 they are calculated. In formulas, the group of source records summarized by one row is available as the value \u201c$group\u201d. For example, you\u2019ll see a column created automatically called \u201ccount\u201d. If you hit \u201cEnter\u201d, you\u2019ll see the formula in it \u2013 len($group) \u2013 that\u2019s just the number of records in that group of records, i.e. the number of companies in that category. For numeric columns in the source table, summary tables automatically get a same-named numeric column containing a sum, with a formula such as SUM($group.funding_total_usd) . A note for Python fans $group is a special Python object. It\u2019s an iterable collection of records. Using an attribute like $group.A is a shorthand for the list of values in the A column of all the records in the group, i.e. it\u2019s roughly equivalent to [r.A for r in $group] . Sometimes, adding the values doesn\u2019t make sense. E.g. the sum of \u201cfounded_year\u201d is meaningless. It\u2019s best to delete this and any other column we don\u2019t need, which leaves us with the \u201cfunding_total_usd\u201d column. Since this column contains large numbers, it\u2019s a good time to look at the \u201cNumber Format\u201d section of its configuration, and click , (or perhaps $ ) to format numbers to be more readable. Let\u2019s add a second summary table. Select \u201cAdd New\u201d again to \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. To get a summary by year, select the \u201cInvestments\u201d table under \u201cSelect Data\u201d, and again use its sum symbol (\u2211) to select the column by which to summarize: \u201cfunded_year\u201d and then click \u201cAdd to page\u201d. This produces a second summary table that shows a record for each year, with each representing a group of \u201cInvestments\u201d rows for that year. The most useful column is \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d, adding all investments made in that year. Let\u2019s delete the unneeded columns. You\u2019ll notice pink values in \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d. That\u2019s because Grist guesses the column type to be an integer.The pink sums are instances where the numbers exceed Javascript\u2019s ability to handle large integers. To correct for this, the type of the column should be switched to \u201cNumeric\u201d (which trades off precision for the ability to represent very large and very small numbers). Change the type to \u201cNumeric\u201c under \u201cColumn options\u201d. This is again a good time to pick a friendlier number format for the column, and to make it wider to fit the longer numbers. Chart, graph, plot # You can make a chart of any data. To this page, we want to add a graphic version of each summary table. Select the \u201cAdd New\u201d button again, pick \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, select \u201cChart\u201d as the widget, and the same table (Companies) and summary column (category_code) as before. Then click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. For a chart, you\u2019ll always follow up by customizing it. Open the right panel, and select \u201cChart\u201d tab / \u201cWidget\u201d subtab. For this first chart, under \u201cChart type\u201d, select \u201cPie Chart\u201d. To construct this chart, first select a label, and then select a series to summarize in the pie chart. Since we want the chart to show \u201ccategory_code\u201d as labels, select this series from the \u201cLabel\u201d dropdown. We want to use \u201cfunding_total_usd\u201d as values, so this should be listed at the top of the \u201cseries\u201d list in the configuration panel. As you move your mouse over the items in that list, use the double vertical bars that show up to drag and drop a series at the top of the list. Alternatively, you can hide the other series from the list by clicking the trash icon. Now add a chart showing a trend by year. Add another \u201cWidget to page\u201d, select \u201cChart\u201d under \u201cWidget\u201d, select \u201cInvestments\u201d under \u201cSelect Data\u201d, click summation ( ) to group by \u201cfunded_year\u201d, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. To customize this chart, stick with the chart type \u201cBar Chart\u201d. From the \u201cX-Axis\u201d dropdown, select the column to use for the X (horizontal) axis values. Under \u2018Series\u2019 select a second (and possible additional) column to be values for the Y (vertical) axis. You can rearrange the sections on the screen into a configuration you\u2019d like to see for a dashboard. Move your mouse to the top left of each section until you see a \u201cdrag handle\u201d icon. Use that icon to drag each section into the desired spot relative to other sections. Once you\u2019re finished, rename the page by hovering over the page name then clicking the three-dot icon to open the menu. Select \u201cRename\u201d and rename to \u201cOverview\u201d. Dynamic charts # If you\u2019ve read our other tutorials on linking data, this will come naturally. Charts are simply a different way to show data, and they can be linked in the same way as tables. For our example, we\u2019ll add a new page with a summary table: select widget \u201cTable\u201d, data \u201cInvestments\u201d, group by \u201cfunded_year\u201d, click \u201cAdd Page\u201d. Let\u2019s rename this new page \u201cBreakdowns\u201d. Next, add a widget to this page, selecting widget \u201cChart\u201d, data \u201cInvestments\u201d. For \u201cGroup By\u201d, we pick two columns: \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d and \u201cfunded_year\u201d. This is why we added the \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d column earlier. We can only group investment records by the category code if we have this code for each investment. The \u201cSelect By\u201d dropdown at the bottom left of the dialog box lists widgets already on the screen that can control the selection of data in the chart we are adding. In \u201cSelect By\u201d, choose \u201cINVESTMENTS [by funded_year]\u201d, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. Note: If you need to make changes to a widget you already added, such as change its type, \u201cGroup By\u201d, or \u201cSelect By\u201d settings, you can always do so from the \u201cData\u201d subtab in the widget settings, using the \u201cEdit Data Selection\u201d button. We want to be able to select a year, and then show a pie chart for that year that displays the total for each category code. The \u201cSelect By\u201d option we chose ensures that only the selected year\u2019s data is used. All that\u2019s left is to change the chart type to \u201cPie Chart\u201d, and set \u201cLabel\u201d to \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d and \u201cSeries\u201d to \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d. Note: Graphs need more screenspace, so our small screenshots will look better if we close the side panels by clicking on the opener icons ( , ). Let\u2019s also sort the table by \u201cfunded_year\u201d. As far as sorting, the highlighted button above the table reminds you that sort settings aren\u2019t saved automatically. Click the green button and select \u201cSave\u201d to do that. What\u2019s the result? We can click through the years (or use arrow keys), and see the distribution by category change. Note: If clicking through the years does not affect the chart, the chart must not be linked. You can check and correct it by using the \u201cthree dots\u201d menu on top right of the chart, clicking \u201cData selection\u201d, and ensuring that \u201cSelect By\u201d dropdown is showing \u201cINVESTMENTS [by funded_year]\u201d. To complete the example, we will add two more sections to this \u201cBreakdowns\u201d page. One will be a table listing company categories, and linked to it will be a chart showing the amount of investment in that category over the years. To add the table of categories, use \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, and select \u201cTable\u201d widget, \u201cInvestments\u201d data, grouped by \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d. The \u201cfunded_year\u201d column in the resulting table is meaningless, and should be deleted. For the last step, we add another chart. We need to remember to group by both \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d \u201cfunded_year\u201d, and to set a suitable \u201cSelect By\u201d widget for it. Since there are two tables on this page, you have a choice of which one will drive the data in this chart. In this case, pick the widget that we just added: \u201cINVESTMENTS [by Company_category_code]\u201d. As in the previous section, we configure the chart by selecting \u201cChart Type\u201d as \u201cBar Chart\u201d, and in the \u201cX-Axis\u201d dropdown, selecting \u201cfunded_year\u201d and under \u201cSeries\u201d, selecting \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d and hiding the rest. We can now click through the categories, and see the history of investment into each one. Next steps # If you\u2019re unfamiliar with how we created the \u201cCompany Details\u201d page that\u2019s present in the example, visit one of these earlier tutorials to learn how: \u2018How to build a Lightweight CRM\u2019, or \u2018Managing your Business in Grist\u2019.

In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to: Create summary tables Create and configure charts Link charts dynamically To explain these features, we\u2019ll use the sample document \u201cInvestment Research\u201d 1 which includes companies and investments in them up to 2013. Let\u2019s take a look at the sample document and then we\u2019ll talk about how to build it so that you can apply these tools to your own data.","title":""},{"location":"investment-research/#exploring-the-example","text":"Open the document \u201c Investment Research \u201d, found in Examples & Templates in your Grist home page. The first thing you\u2019ll see is \u201cOverview\u201d. This page contains two charts next to two tables. The top left has a pie chart showing the distribution of investments by category. The table next to it has the same data in tabular form. Below the pie chart is a bar graph showing the total investments raised by year. It is also accompanied by the same data in the table next to it in tabular form. All these charts and tables are examples of \u201csummary tables\u201d, which we\u2019ll describe below. The next page, \u201cBreakdowns\u201d, also contains two tables and two charts, but these are linked dynamically and offer much more detailed insight into the data. On the top left is a table showing the total funding by year (the same table as we saw on the previous page). This table serves as a driver for the chart next to it. When you click on a year in the table, the pie chart updates to show the distribution of investments in that year. Similarly, the bottom table shows investments by category. When you click on any category, the line chart next to it updates to show the history of funding in that category over the years. Note how powerful this is, and how much insight you can gain from it. For instance, you can see that Advertising category has been getting a lot of investment in NY since 2007, but was overtaken by E-commerce in 2013, while the Fashion category had a major spike in 2011. On the next page, \u201cCompany Details\u201d, we get to see the granular data of this dataset. Here, we see a list of companies and the categories they fall into. Each company shown has a link pointing to its listing on the Crunchbase website. Selecting a company shows a card with its details, as well as a list of all the investments it has received. This is where we begin to see the power of Grist. The original dataset is a flat spreadsheet of companies, and an even bigger spreadsheet of investments. By displaying the data graphically, the data comes alive, making it powerful and useful.","title":"Exploring the example"},{"location":"investment-research/#how-can-i-make-this","text":"With Grist, presenting your own data in graphic form is a few easy steps away.

Each investment row only needs to contain a reference to a company, and the data specific to that investment. To make it so, find a column that identifies a company uniquely. In this dataset, the first column, \u201ccompany_permalink\u201d, does it best 3 . Click on the arrow in the column header and click \u201cColumn Options\u201d.

Let\u2019s also sort the table by \u201cfunded_year\u201d. As far as sorting, the highlighted button above the table reminds you that sort settings aren\u2019t saved automatically. Click the green button and select \u201cSave\u201d to do that. What\u2019s the result? We can click through the years (or use arrow keys), and see the distribution by category change. Note: If clicking through the years does not affect the chart, the chart must not be linked. You can check and correct it by using the \u201cthree dots\u201d menu on top right of the chart, clicking \u201cData selection\u201d, and ensuring that \u201cSelect By\u201d dropdown is showing \u201cINVESTMENTS [by funded_year]\u201d. To complete the example, we will add two more sections to this \u201cBreakdowns\u201d page. One will be a table listing company categories, and linked to it will be a chart showing the amount of investment in that category over the years. To add the table of categories, use \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, and select \u201cTable\u201d widget, \u201cInvestments\u201d data, grouped by \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d. The \u201cfunded_year\u201d column in the resulting table is meaningless, and should be deleted. For the last step, we add another chart. We need to remember to group by both \u201cCompany_category_code\u201d \u201cfunded_year\u201d, and to set a suitable \u201cSelect By\u201d widget for it. Since there are two tables on this page, you have a choice of which one will drive the data in this chart. In this case, pick the widget that we just added: \u201cINVESTMENTS [by Company_category_code]\u201d. As in the previous section, we configure the chart by selecting \u201cChart Type\u201d as \u201cBar Chart\u201d, and in the \u201cX-Axis\u201d dropdown, selecting \u201cfunded_year\u201d and under \u201cSeries\u201d, selecting \u201craised_amount_usd\u201d and hiding the rest. We can now click through the categories, and see the history of investment into each one.","title":"Dynamic charts"},{"location":"investment-research/#next-steps","text":"If you\u2019re unfamiliar with how we created the \u201cCompany Details\u201d page that\u2019s present in the example, visit one of these earlier tutorials to learn how: \u2018How to build a Lightweight CRM\u2019, or \u2018Managing your Business in Grist\u2019.

In this example, we\u2019ll look at an organization that runs after-school activities for children. Feel free to refer to the Class Enrollment document, found on our Examples & Templates page. In this exercise we will show how to go about planning, designing, and creating such document. Planning # A little planning ahead will help you get a solution faster. Think about what kinds of data you are working with, and what kinds of workflows you will need. You don\u2019t need to anticipate everything when you start. You can easily add complexity later, as you\u2019ll see below. Our organization runs a number of classes for children. Each class has an instructor and multiple students. Students may enroll in multiple classes, and may return year after year. For each class, we\u2019ll want to see the list of enrolled students, and if there are spots available. When a parent calls, we want a convenient way to enroll a new student, or to change or cancel a student\u2019s enrollment. If this sounds like building an application, that\u2019s exactly what we are doing. As you\u2019ll see, however, it is no harder than building a spreadsheet. Data Modeling # The better you model your business data, the easier your work will be. In a way, you are doing database design as well as building a custom application. Grist just makes it easier. Let\u2019s start with the classes and their instructors. We need a list of classes and instructors. The same instructor can teach different classes, so instructors and classes will live in different tables. Let\u2019s call them \u201cClasses\u201d and \u201cStaff\u201d. Each class has a single instructor, so one of the properties of a class will be that class\u2019s instructor. Classes and Instructors # When starting from scratch, you\u2019ll create a new empty document (see Creating a document ), rename the initial empty table \u201cTable1\u201d to \u201cClasses\u201d, add the columns you need, and type in some classes. To follow the steps of this tutorial, you can instead import Classes.csv (or simply refer to the \u201cAfterschool Program\u201d example document). For the Staff table, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button and select \u201cAdd Empty Table\u201d. Rename it to \u201cStaff\u201d, create some columns, and enter some data about instructors. Or import Staff.csv to use sample data and save a few steps. We want the Instructor column in the Classes table to be a reference to the Staff table. Currently, the Staff table doesn\u2019t have any column that uniquely identifies each record. For setting up references, it\u2019s a good idea to add one. In this case, we\u2019ll add a \u201cFull Name\u201d column to the Staff table. Formulas # Click on the \u201cStaff\u201d page, and add a \u201cFull Name\u201d column using the column menu or the Alt + = shortcut, and type \u201cFull Name\u201d in the new column\u2019s header. Create a formula by typing in a value into any cell in the new column, starting with the equal sign (\u201c=\u201d). Enter the formula as $Last_Name + \", \" + $First_Name . You may use Excel-like syntax to the same effect: CONCAT($Last_Name, \", \", $First_Name) . In Grist, a formula always applies to every record in the table. Grist supports Python in formulas, and most Excel functions, which have uppercase names. Because formulas apply to every row, you should see the Full Name column automatically filled. References # Click on the \u201cClasses\u201d page again, and open \u201cColumn Options\u201d for the Instructor column. We\u2019ll turn it into a reference to Staff . In the right-side panel, set the column type to \u201cReference\u201d (in database terms, this is known as a \u201cforeign key\u201d), and set the referenced table to \u201cStaff\u201d. For the \u201cSHOW COLUMN\u201d dropdown, select \u201cFull Name\u201d, which is the new column we just added. Click the \u201cApply\u201d button to complete this change of the column\u2019s type (if the column is empty, there is no confirmation step). You can now assign an instructor to any class. Click on a cell in the Instructor column. You can hit Enter and choose from among the available instructors in the Staff table, or start typing to use auto-complete. Next, we will continue with students and their enrollments. Students # Each class has a number of students. So, we\u2019ll need a table of students. Again, add a new empty table, rename it to \u201cStudents\u201d, and fill it with the students\u2019 names, grade levels, etc. Or import Students.csv to use sample data and save a few steps. Let\u2019s add here a \u201cFull Name\u201d formula column, just like in the Staff table. It will come in handy. Many-to-Many Relationships # A student can take more than one class. Let\u2019s remember also that there are classes in the past and in the future, and keeping this historical data is valuable. So, for each student, there may be multiple classes, and in each class, there are multiple students. A good way to model such a relation is by adding the concept of an \u201cenrollment\u201d and a new Enrollments table. An \u201cenrollment\u201d represents one student being enrolled in one class. It has some useful properties of its own: the enrollment status (Confirmed, Waitlisted, or Cancelled), whether they have paid for the class, and perhaps more. In database design, this is known as a \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationship. The extra table is known as a \u201cjoin\u201d table. Essentially, it adds a record for each student-class connection, and turns the \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationship into two \u201cone-to-many\u201d relationships. This relationship: becomes this: So, let\u2019s add a new table, name it \u201cEnrollments\u201d, and add the columns we need. Here too, to follow along, you may import sample data from Enrollments.csv . In Column Options for the column Student , set the Column Type to \u201cReference\u201d, set the referenced table to Students , and select \u201cFull Name\u201d as the column to show. For the column Class , set the Column Type to \u201cReference\u201d, the referenced table to Classes , and select \u201cClass Code\u201d as the column to show. It\u2019s possible to enter enrollment data by adding records to this table and using auto-complete in the Student and Class column. Below, we will set up a much more convenient way to enroll students. Class View # One of our goals in the Planning stage was to see a list of enrolled students for each class. Now that the data tables are in place, we can create a page that does this. Click \u201cAdd New\u201d, then \u201cAdd Page\u201d to open the widget picker. Select to show a table of Classes , and click \u201cAdd Page\u201d. The new page shows a list of classes. Let\u2019s rename this page \u201cClass View\u201d. Next, add the Enrollments table linked to the table of classes. Click \u201cAdd New\u201d again, then \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In the widget picker, select to show a table of Enrollments . For \u201cSELECT BY\u201d, choose \u201cCLASSES\u201d, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. We get two tables side-by-side. Selecting a class shows all enrollments in that class, each of which references a particular student and includes some other enrollment info. We can go a step further to make this view convenient for us. Let\u2019s add a Class card to this view. Click \u201cAdd New\u201d and \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In the widget picker, select widget \u201cCard\u201d for the Classes data. For \u201cSELECT BY\u201d, choose \u201cCLASSES\u201d again, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. We can similarly add a card for the instructor leading this class. Again, click \u201cAdd New\u201d > \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, and select \u201cCard\u201d for the Staff data. For \u201cSELECT BY\u201d, you can now pick \u201cCLASSES \u2022 Instructor\u201d. You can change the look of the new cards. Click the three-dot menu on the top right of the Card you\u2019d like to change, and choose \u201cWidget options\u201d. Find the \u201cTheme\u201d dropdown in the right panel, and select \u201cCompact\u201d. Here is what we now have in Class View page: It\u2019s a good time to clean up this page by hiding columns and fields that are duplicated or distracting. Check out Configuring field lists for an efficient way to select which fields to show, and Custom Layouts for rearranging widgets on the page. Enrollment View # Our other stated goal was a convenient way to enroll a student, and to see or adjust a given student\u2019s enrollments. Let\u2019s add a page for this. Click \u201cAdd New\u201d > \u201cAdd Page\u201d, and select a table of Students . We\u2019ll rename the new page to \u201cEnrollment View\u201d. When we select a student here, we\u2019d like to see all enrollments for this student. So click \u201cAdd New\u201d > \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d, and add a table of Enrollments . To link the new widget to the Students widget in the page, set the \u201cSELECT BY\u201d dropdown to \u201cSTUDENTS\u201d, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. Now you can click on a student\u2019s name on the left and see the classes that student is enrolled in on the right. You can enroll the selected student into a class by simply entering a class code in the special blank row at the bottom of the enrollments list. As usual, the Class reference column offers auto-complete. You can hide the \u201cStudent\u201d column in \u201cENROLLMENTS\u201d table, since it will always show the selected student anyway. If you\u2019d like to include more info about the classes in the Enrollments table, select Column Options for the Class column, and click \u201c+ Add Column\u201d in the side panel. Any of the fields associated with a class are available. If you examine the columns you add this way, you\u2019ll see that they are simply formulas of the form $Class.Times . Adding Layers # If you are working with children, you are talking to their parents. You\u2019ll need to have the parents\u2019 names and contact info, which you can add as columns to the students table. You\u2019re likely to find that some parents have multiple children that enroll in classes together. Recognizing the parent-child relationship in your database may seem like a complex step, but it will likely simplify your daily workflow. So, let\u2019s add one more table: Families . We\u2019ll include the parent name and contact info, and link each child to a record here. You can import sample data from Families.csv . Note that we added a Full Name column here as for other tables that list people. In the Students table, we\u2019ll add a column named \u201cFamily\u201d, and make it a Reference to Families . The example data already has families filled in, and conversion to reference looks up the text to set correct references. If you were entering new data, you could link students to families using auto-complete as with other reference columms. Let\u2019s change our \u201cEnrollment View\u201d to list families first. This way, when a parent calls, you can pick the right record and see all of their children and enrollments for each child. In the \u201cEnrollment View\u201d page, click \u201cAdd New\u201d > \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. Select to show a table of Families . Rearrange the widgets to have Families on the left, and Students and Enrollments to the right of it. Now link students to Families: click the three-dot menu on the top right of the STUDENTS table, and choose \u201cData Selection\u201d. In the side panel, you can set \u201cSELECT BY\u201d widget to \u201cFAMILIES\u201d. Finally, you can add Card widgets for details of the selected family, and of the selected student, and rearrange the widgets on the page to create a layout that\u2019s perfect for talking to a parent. You select a parent, see their children, and then select a child to see their enrollments. It\u2019s easy to add an enrollment record for a new class, or to change a record (e.g. mark it as \u201ccancelled\u201d), to add another child, or to add a new family. Example Document # The \u201cAfterschool Program\u201d example includes everything described above and a bit more. In particular, it adds a Count field to Classes to calculate the number of enrolled students, and a Spots Left field to show the number of spots remaining, by comparing Count to Max_Students : The formula for Count is len(Enrollments.lookupRecords(Class=$id, Status=\"Confirmed\")) . The formula for Spots Left is max($Max_Students - $Count, 0) or \"Full\" . These make for a more useful Class View page, where it\u2019s now easy to see at a glance which classes have spots remaining.","title":"Manage business data"},{"location":"afterschool-program/#how-to-manage-business-data","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

To link the new widget to the Students widget in the page, set the \u201cSELECT BY\u201d dropdown to \u201cSTUDENTS\u201d, and click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d. Now you can click on a student\u2019s name on the left and see the classes that student is enrolled in on the right. You can enroll the selected student into a class by simply entering a class code in the special blank row at the bottom of the enrollments list. As usual, the Class reference column offers auto-complete. You can hide the \u201cStudent\u201d column in \u201cENROLLMENTS\u201d table, since it will always show the selected student anyway. If you\u2019d like to include more info about the classes in the Enrollments table, select Column Options for the Class column, and click \u201c+ Add Column\u201d in the side panel. Any of the fields associated with a class are available. If you examine the columns you add this way, you\u2019ll see that they are simply formulas of the form $Class.Times .","title":"Enrollment View"},{"location":"afterschool-program/#adding-layers","text":"If you are working with children, you are talking to their parents. You\u2019ll need to have the parents\u2019 names and contact info, which you can add as columns to the students table. You\u2019re likely to find that some parents have multiple children that enroll in classes together. Recognizing the parent-child relationship in your database may seem like a complex step, but it will likely simplify your daily workflow. So, let\u2019s add one more table: Families . We\u2019ll include the parent name and contact info, and link each child to a record here. You can import sample data from Families.csv . Note that we added a Full Name column here as for other tables that list people. In the Students table, we\u2019ll add a column named \u201cFamily\u201d, and make it a Reference to Families . The example data already has families filled in, and conversion to reference looks up the text to set correct references. If you were entering new data, you could link students to families using auto-complete as with other reference columms. Let\u2019s change our \u201cEnrollment View\u201d to list families first. This way, when a parent calls, you can pick the right record and see all of their children and enrollments for each child. In the \u201cEnrollment View\u201d page, click \u201cAdd New\u201d > \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. Select to show a table of Families . Rearrange the widgets to have Families on the left, and Students and Enrollments to the right of it. Now link students to Families: click the three-dot menu on the top right of the STUDENTS table, and choose \u201cData Selection\u201d. In the side panel, you can set \u201cSELECT BY\u201d widget to \u201cFAMILIES\u201d. Finally, you can add Card widgets for details of the selected family, and of the selected student, and rearrange the widgets on the page to create a layout that\u2019s perfect for talking to a parent. You select a parent, see their children, and then select a child to see their enrollments. It\u2019s easy to add an enrollment record for a new class, or to change a record (e.g. mark it as \u201ccancelled\u201d), to add another child, or to add a new family.","title":"Adding Layers"},{"location":"afterschool-program/#example-document","text":"The \u201cAfterschool Program\u201d example includes everything described above and a bit more.

The formula for Spots Left is max($Max_Students - $Count, 0) or \"Full\" . These make for a more useful Class View page, where it\u2019s now easy to see at a glance which classes have spots remaining.","title":"Example Document"},{"location":"creating-doc/","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

You can import a file to start a new Grist document , or to add data to an existing document. Grist supports imports of Excel, CSV, JSON, tab-separated files and from Google Drive . To start a new Grist document, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button on the home screen and choose \u201cImport document\u201d, as described in starting a new Grist document . To add to an existing document, open that document, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button and then \u201cImport from file\u201d. By default, each imported table is added as a new Grist table, but when examining the preview dialog for an import, you have an option to change the destination to an existing Grist table. You can also import any of the same formats from a URL, using the \u201cImport from URL\u201d option. The Import dialog # When you import data into an existing document, Grist opens an import dialog to show you what will be imported. This dialog offers available import options, lets you choose whether to create a new table or add to an existing one, and shows a preview of the data. The \u201cImport options\u201d link on the top right is sometimes useful when importing delimited files. Grist guesses the settings to parse the data (such as the field delimiter), but if it guesses incorrectly, you can adjust the settings. Guessing data structure # In all cases, when you import a file, Grist makes guesses about the structure of the file. For Excel files, Grist treats each sheet as a separated table. For CSV and other delimited formats, one file becomes one table. For both Excel and delimited files, Grist tries to detect whether the headers are included and which line they occur in. If Grist detects there are no headers, it will name columns as \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, etc. Grist automatically tries to parse numbers, dates, and boolean fields to detect the most suitable type for each column. It tries to be lossless: e.g. if it marks a column as numeric, any text values in it (such as \u201cN/A\u201d) will remain in the imported table, but will be highlighted due to the type mismatch. You can always rename tables and columns after an import, as well as convert types. Import from Google Drive # Importing from a Google Drive is as easy as importing from an Excel file or a CSV file. You can either provide an URL of a file stored in the Google Drive or use a Google File Picker to choose a file from your own drive. To use a Picker, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button and choose \u201cImport from Google Drive\u201d. To import, sign in to your Google Account by clicking the \u201cSign in\u201d button and following the sign-in process. Grist will ask for a permission to read the file you will import from Google Drive. We won\u2019t read any other files on your drive \u2014 just the single file you choose to import. Once the file has been chosen, the rest of the process is the same as importing from an Excel file. In the import dialog you may configure what data to import, and which destination table to add it to. If you have an URL to a file or a spreadsheet stored on your Google Drive or a file that is publicly accessible, you can import it directly using the \u201cImport from URL\u201d option from the \u201cAdd New\u201d menu. If the file is not shared publicly, Grist will ask you for permission to read files from your Google Drive. If you don\u2019t want to allow Grist to read your files, it will open up Google File Picker where you can select the file you want to import. Import to an existing table # By default, Grist imports new data as new tables, but the Import dialog allows you to change the destination and import data into an existing table. When importing to an existing table, Grist will attempt to match the columns from your imported file to the columns in the destination table. To manually specify column matching, click the \u2018Source Column\u2019 drop down to open a menu with a list of unused columns from your imported file. Click on a column name to match it to a destination column, or select \u2018Skip\u2019 to skip importing data from that column. You can also specify a formula for each imported column by clicking \u2018Apply Formula\u2019 from the \u2018Source Column\u2019 drop down menu. Formulas can reference one or more imported columns, and the result of evaluating the formula will be shown in the preview after closing the editor. Importing to an existing table is best suited for importing multiple datasets containing similar structure. For instance, you could import a bank statement as a new table, then import more statements from other months into the same table. For developers, the Grist API offers a more powerful way to add data to a Grist document. Updating existing records # Suppose the table we are importing to already contains some of the data in our file. We\u2019d like Grist to update these existing records rather than duplicate them. We can tell Grist to update these records by checking the \u201cUpdate existing records\u201d option, and specifying which fields to use for matching incoming data against existing records. An imported row and an existing record that have the same values for all of the selected merge fields are considered the same record. In this case, importing will update the fields of the record with the imported data. Blank values from the imported data will be skipped, leaving the corresponding fields in the original record unchanged. Note: If there are multiple imported rows that have the same values for the selected merge fields, the last row will be used for matching and updating. If there are multiple existing records that have the same values for the selected merge fields, only the first record will be updated if a matching imported row is found. Each time the merge fields are changed, Grist will generate a preview of the updates that will be made to the destination table, and display them in the preview table. Changes are highlighted as follows: New records have all of their fields highlighted in green. Updated records have red and green highlighting for any changed fields: red (with a strikethrough) for existing values from the destination, and green for new values from the imported file. Unchanged records have no highlighting. Field values that exist in the destination table, but are blank in the imported file, are distinguished by a light gray font color.","title":"Importing more data"},{"location":"imports/#importing-more-data","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

If Grist detects there are no headers, it will name columns as \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, etc. Grist automatically tries to parse numbers, dates, and boolean fields to detect the most suitable type for each column. It tries to be lossless: e.g. if it marks a column as numeric, any text values in it (such as \u201cN/A\u201d) will remain in the imported table, but will be highlighted due to the type mismatch.

Tab , Shift + Tab saves your entry and moves your cursor to the next or previous cell. Enter saves your entry and moves your cursor to the next row. Shift + Enter adds a newline inside your cell. Copying and pasting # You can copy data from Grist or paste data into it. If the pasted range is longer than the available records, new records will be added. Note that Grist does not create new columns automatically. If the pasted data has more columns than the grid displays, extra columns will be omitted.

Pages & widgets # Unlike traditional spreadsheets, in Grist you can create multiple views of the same data, and display multiple data sets on one page. This allows you to create useful dashboards and custom applications tailored to your needs. Pages # In Grist, you organize your document into \u201cpages\u201d. These are listed in the left panel, with collapsible groups. You may rearrange and group pages in the left panel by dragging them to suit your needs. You can rename, remove, or duplicate pages using the three-dots menu next to the page name in the list. Renaming the page does not edit data tables\u2019 names or widget titles. See changing widget below to learn how to edit table and widget names. Duplicating a page duplicates views of data and does not duplicate the data itself. Removing a page does not delete data. When removing the last view of data, you will be asked if you want to delete only the view, but not the data itself; or if you want to delete both the page and the underlying data table(s). Learn more about your document\u2019s data in the raw data page . Note that pages can also be renamed by clicking the page name on top of the screen. Using the opener icon ( ) near the top of the left panel, you can collapse the panel to show only the initials of each page, leaving more screen space to view your data. To add a new page, use the \u201cAdd New\u201d button, and click \u201cAdd Page\u201d. At that point, you\u2019ll get to choose the page widget to include in the new page. Using Emojis in Page and Widget Names You can add any emoji to a Page or Widget name. The keyboard shortcut to open the emoji keyboard is Windows Logo + . (period) on PC or Command + Control + Space on Mac. You can also copy/paste an online source like Emojipedia . When a Page name starts with an emoji, it will replace the page icon. Page widgets # A page contains sections, such as tables or charts, which we call \u201cpage widgets\u201d. Each page widget shows data from one table. A page may contain more than one page widget, and you can arrange and link them to create useful layouts. Here are the supported kinds of page widgets. The salient features of each one are described on separate pages. Table : similar to the spreadsheet grid and a good way to see many records at once. Card : shows a single record in a form-like layout which you can customize. Card List : uses the same layout options as a card, displays a scrollable list of records. Chart : plots data on a chart with support for several different chart types. Calendar : displays event data in a calendar view. Custom : inserts a custom webpage, optionally granting it access to the document\u2019s data. There is a special page called raw data that lists all data tables in your document and summarizes your document\u2019s usage statistics. Navigate to the raw data page by clicking on the Raw Data link in the bottom left of the pages menu. Widget picker # The menu opened by the \u201cAdd New\u201d button has options \u201cAdd Page\u201d and \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In either case, you\u2019ll see the \u201cpage widget picker\u201d where you can choose your desired widget: You can select the type of widget and the table of data to show (or \u201cNew Table\u201d to create a new table). The \u201csummary\u201d icon ( ) allows you to summarize data . When adding a widget to an existing page, you\u2019ll also see a \u201cSelect By\u201d option, which allows linking this widget to another one already on the page. This process is described in greater detail in Linking widgets . Once you\u2019ve added widgets, they can be moved around and resized, as described in Custom Layouts . Changing widget or its data # If you\u2019d like to change a widget or the data it displays after it\u2019s added, you may do so. Click the three-dots button on the top right of your widget, and select \u201cWidget options\u201d. This opens the right-side panel. Click on \u201cChange Widget\u201d. You can then use the widget picker to change the widget or the data it displays. You may also edit the widget\u2019s title or add a description. Renaming widgets # You can rename widgets in several ways. We saw in the section above that you can edit a widget\u2019s title or add a description from the Widget tab of the Creator Panel. Another way is to click on the widget title above a widget. From here, you can edit the widget\u2019s title, the underlying data table\u2019s name or add a description. By default, the widget title is the data table\u2019s name. To override this, enter a new title under \u2018Widget Title\u2019. Learn more about data tables in the raw data page . Configuring field lists # Although different kinds of page widgets look very different, they all represent a list of records. Any of the widget types can be used to show the same underlying data. In a Table , each record is represented by a row, and columns represent the same kind of value for each record. Note that the raw data page lists all data tables. In a Card List , each row of the underlying data is shown as a card. Each column in the data corresponds to a field in this card. When talking about a Card widget, we\u2019ll use the term \u201cfield\u201d , which conceptually is the same as a \u201ccolumn\u201d in a Table widget. A Card is just like a Card List, but shows only one row of data at a time. In a Chart , each row of the underlying data table becomes a graphical element, such as a point on a line chart, a bar in a bar chart, or a slice of a pie chart. In this context, the columns of our data table are better known as data \u201cseries\u201d . Click on the opener icon ( ) to open the right panel. Depending on the currently-selected widget, you might see a tab for configuring a Column, Field, or Series. These are not different in substance, but different terms make more sense for different widgets. Clicking on the widget tab (highlighted in green in the images above), you\u2019ll see subtabs for \u201cWidget\u201d, \u201cSort & Filter\u201d, and \u201cData\u201d. We\u2019ll focus on the first one: \u201cWidget\u201d. You\u2019ll see options specific to the type of the selected widget, and below that two lists: \u201cVisible Columns\u201d and \u201cHidden Columns\u201d. The \u201cHidden Columns\u201d are the columns available in the data, but not shown in this widget. In a Card, these lists would show up as \u201cVisible Fields\u201d / \u201cHidden Fields\u201d. In a chart, they show up as \u201cVisible Series\u201d / \u201cHidden Series\u201d. These lists allow you to include, exclude, or rearrange fields in a widget. As you move your mouse over the items in the list, use the \u201ceye\u201d icons that pop up to show or hide them. Alternatively, you can select several items using the checkboxes, and hide or show them together. This ordered list of fields can be used to customize any of the page widget types.

From your document, navigate to the raw data page by clicking on the Raw Data link in the bottom left of the pages menu. Unlike other pages , the layout in the raw data page cannot be customized.

This is different from other pages where it is possible to remove a view of data and not delete the data itself. Click on a data table to open it. Note that in the creator panel the widget type cannot be changed. Renaming the widget also renames the data table. Because raw data is intended to show all data, columns cannot be hidden, either.

Duplicating Data # Tables can be duplicated from the Raw Data page. Click the three-dot icon to the right of the table you wish to duplicate then select \u2018Duplicate Table\u2019 from the menu.

If the original table has any access rules, those rules will not be duplicated. Only the document\u2019s default rules will apply to the copied table. The duplicate table is a new table that is not linked to the original. Meaning, if you update data in the copy, the original table will not be updated, and vice versa. Note that instead of duplicating tables, it\u2019s usually better to segment data by adding a new column. Let\u2019s use expenses as an example. Rather than having separate tables for each month\u2019s expenses, it is better to include all data in a single table and create a new column called \u201cMonth\u201d to segment rows into months.

Grist offers several ways to search within your data, or to organize data to be at your fingertips. Searching # At the top of the document screen, you\u2019ll see a magnifying glass icon ( ) which opens a spreadsheet-like search. You can also start searching using the keyboard shortcut \u2318 F (Mac) or Ctrl + F (Windows). As you type into the search textbox, Grist will move the cursor to the next cell containing your search text. If there are no more matches in the current widget or page, the cursor will move to the next widget or switch to the next page. Sorting # It\u2019s easy to find a word in a dictionary, but it wouldn\u2019t be if the words weren\u2019t sorted! Grist offers flexible and convenient sorting options, which are quite different from a traditional spreadsheet. To sort a table in Grist by a column, open the menu from the column\u2019s header and select \u201cSort\u201d: In the same menu item, you can choose to sort in ascending or descending order. Difference from Excel : Importantly, sorting does not change any formula calculations, it only changes the order in which you see the records. This is different from spreadsheets like Excel. Another difference is that the sort setting is \u201cactive\u201d: if you add a record, or change a cell that\u2019s used for sorting, the record will jump into its correct position in the sort order. See Saving Row Positions below for an option more similar to Excel\u2019s behavior. Multiple Columns # When a table is sorted, you can click another column to add it to the sort: The second column determines the order of records whose values in the first column are the same. You can add more columns to the sort. For example, you could: Sort employees first by Department, then by Last Name, then by First Name. Sort transactions first by Date, then by Amount. Sort tasks first by \u2018Is Completed\u2019 column, then by Priority. Saving Sort Settings # Because sorting only affects your view of data, you can sort data in a Grist document even if you do not have edit access to it. If you can write to a document, then you can also save sort settings. When you change sorting on a table, the icon on top of it gets highlighted in green. Click it to see the currently active setting, as well as the options to manipulate them (e.g. remove a column from the sort), to save the setting, or to revert your changes: When you save sort settings, they will apply to the widget any time this page is opened, either by you or other collaborators. Multiple Views : Just like you can create multiple pages showing data from the same table, you can have different sort settings on each view of the data. E.g. you could have one view showing credit card transactions sorted by date, and another showing them sorted by amount. Sorting from Side Panel # You can sort widgets other than Table, such as Card List or Chart, using the \u201cSort & Filter\u201d subtab in the side panel: You can add one or more columns, save or revert settings and use advanced sorting options. Advance sorting options # The \u201cSort & Filter\u201d subtab exposes additional sorting options that might be useful for various column types: Use choice position \u2013 available on Choice column, sorts records using the configured order of choice items, rather then their names. Empty values last \u2013 in alphabetical order empty values are shown first by default, use this option to put them at the end. Natural sort \u2013 for Text column will treat multi-digit numbers in strings as if they were a single character, allowing more human-friendly ordering. For example, using natural sort , Product10 will be positioned after Product2 . Saving Row Positions # When you use the side panel, you\u2019ll notice one extra button: \u201cUpdate Data\u201d. If you click it, the current position of the records relative to each other is saved, and the active sort by your selected columns is turned off. In other words, rows will no longer jump into place according to values in certain columns, but will remain in the place they are in. You will also be able to reorder rows manually by dragging them. Filtering # You can choose to see only a subset of data in a table by filtering for certain values in a column. Open the column menu from any column\u2019s header, and click \u201cFilter Data\u201d. You\u2019ll see a dialog listing the values in the column: Uncheck the values you don\u2019t want to see, or click \u201cNone\u201d and then check only the values you do want to see. The search bar at the top of the dialog lets you find values of interest if the list is long. Click \u201cApply\u201d to apply your setting. You can filter by more than one column. Only those rows will appear which match all of the filters. As with sorting, you can save filters to the view. Click the highlighted \u201cSort & Filter\u201d icon on top of the table: You\u2019ll see the columns for which there are active filters, and options to save the filter, or to revert to saved settings. As with sorting, you can create different widgets or pages showing the same table with different filter settings. For example, you could have one page showing event attendees with status \u201cConfirmed\u201d and another one showing those with status \u201cPending\u201d. Range Filtering # Certain column types allow for filtering within a range of values. When filtering a numeric or integer type column, you have the option to filter within a range of numbers. For example, if you only want to see high-value purchases in a table of credit card transactions , you could add a filter for the amount column and enter a minimum value of $500. The table would be filtered to show any transactions with an amount of $500 or greater. When filtering a date or datetime type column, you have the option to filter within a specified date range. The range can be entered into the \u201cStart\u201d and \u201cEnd\u201d fields, or selected on a calendar. Perhaps you went on vacation and want to see all transactions during that time. We could add a filter to the Date column to see all transactions within the date range of the trip. You can also filter date and datetime type columns by a relative range, which is a range relative to today\u2019s date. For example, you might want to filter for tasks due in the next 14 days. That filter would update each day so that it is always filtering by 14 days into the future, relative to today\u2019s date. When filtering a date or datetime column, there are several relative ranges suggested as a shortcut, as seen in the image below. If you use the calendar to select a range of dates, you can also convert each absolute date into a relative date by selecting from the list of relative dates available. Pinning Filters # Filters can be pinned at the top of a table for quick filtering. By default, filters will be pinned when first applied to a table. To unpin a filter, click the filter button then click the pin icon. If you unpin a filter button, any saved filters will still be applied but the button will no longer be visible. It may be useful to save the buttons without any filtering to create a quick filter toolbar. If you do save settings with filters applied, that saves it for future sessions and other team members will see the same thing. Complex Filters # To filter for more complex conditions, create a new formula column and filter this column for values of \u201ctrue\u201d. For example, to filter for \u201cPersons with salary over $100,000 or a position of \u2018Board Member\u2019\u201c, you can use a formula like this: $Salary > 100000 or $Position == 'Board Member' This will produce a column of true and false values, which you can filter for the value true .","title":"Search, sort & filter"},{"location":"search-sort-filter/#search-sort-and-filter","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

In the area above the \u201cSeries\u201d section of the creator panel, you may configure the x-axis for most charts, or the labels for pie and donut charts. Bar Chart # Needs an x-axis and at least one series to plot along the y-axis. Additional series create additional bars at each point on the x-axis. To stack series onto the same bar, select the \u201cStack series\u201d checkbox. Line Chart # Needs an x-axis and at least one series to plot along the y-axis. Additional series specify Y values for additional lines. Pie Chart # Needs pie slice labels and one series for the pie slice sizes. Area Chart # Similar to a line chart, needs an x-axis and at least one series to plot along the y-axis. Additional series specify Y values for additional lines. Scatter Plot # Needs a label and two or more series. The label applies to the points. The series apply the X and Y values for each point, respectively. Additional series specify Y values for additional sets of points. Kaplan-Meier Plot # The Kaplan-Meier Plot is useful for certain studies, and needs one label and one series. The label applies to the lines being plotted. The series gives a survival time or time-to-failure of that point. The plot shows the survival times on the X axis, and the number of points that survive at that time on the Y axis. Chart options # A number of chart options are available, some of them specific to certain chart types. Split Series : When checked, an extra series is to be selected under the \u2018Split Series\u2019 dropdown. The series should contain a group label for each data point. All points with the same group value are plotted as a separate line. For example: Invert Y-axis : When checked the Y axis is flipped, with smaller values above and larger values below. Connect gaps [for Line Charts only]: When checked, gaps caused by missing values are connected by connecting neighboring points. The \u201cShow Markers\u201d option described next can be used to keep a visual cue for which points are present.

Mais la bonne nouvelle est que vous pouvez rejoindre la communaut\u00e9 de traduction pour nous aider \ud83d\udc4b . The Custom widget allows a user to insert almost anything in their document. To create a custom widget currently requires knowledge of web development, and access to a public web server (for example, GitHub Pages). A good use for custom widgets is to view records or tables in new ways. Using Grist as your data model and modern HTML/CSS/JS as your view is very powerful. Minimal example # To demonstrate to a web developer how custom widgets work, there is a minimal working example at: https://public.getgrist.com/911KcgKA95oQ/Minimal-Custom-Widget/m/fork The example shows a table with some random data (names for pets), and two custom widgets, one showing the selected row in the table as JSON, and the other showing all rows of the table as JSON. If you change data in the table, or move the cursor, the custom widgets update as appropriate. The source code for the widgets is at: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget/tree/master/inspect It is stripped down to the essentials. Here is the full source code of the onRecord widget that shows one row of data: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <title>onRecord</title> <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> </head> <body> <pre id=\"readout\">Waiting for data...</pre> <script> grist.ready(); grist.onRecord(function(record) { document.getElementById('readout').innerHTML = JSON.stringify(record, null, 2); }); </script> </body> </html> The \u201cGrist\u201d parts of this are: Including https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js to get the Grist API. Calling grist.ready to let Grist know the widget is ready to go. Calling grist.onRecord to subscribe to the current row of the table. After that, everything else is regular HTML/CSS/JS. Once you have data coming in, you can render it any way you like, using React, Vue.js, or your favorite framework. For example, you could render records as a printable invoice , or use some obscure chart format that Grist doesn\u2019t currently support. Adding a custom widget # To add a custom widget that reads from a table, click on Add New , then Add Widget to Page . Then: For Select Widget choose Custom to get a Custom Widget. For Select Data choose the table you want the widget to read data from. Optionally, choose Select By to control the selected data further (read Linking Page Widgets for the possibilities). The custom widget is initially blank. To configure it, click the three-dots button on the top right of the custom widget, and select \u201cWidget options\u201d. In the CUSTOM settings section where it says Enter Custom URL , put the link to your custom widget. Here is a test widget to simply show table data in JSON: https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/inspect/onRecords.html And here\u2019s one to show the selected row only (make sure \u201cSelect By\u201d is set for the custom widget): https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/inspect/onRecord.html Access level # When you put a link to a custom webpage it will be immediately rendered inside the section. Now you have the option to grant that webpage access to data in your document. The following access levels are available: No document access : the webpage is shown in the widget, but it has no access to the Grist document containing the widget. Read selected table : the webpage is shown in the widget, and is given read access to the table the widget is configured to select data from. Full document access : the webpage is shown in the widget, and has full access to read and modify the Grist document containing the widget. The webpage should be owned and controlled by you or someone you trust. With Read selected table permissions, a widget could send the data it accesses to a third party. With Full document access permissions, a widget could send all the document data to a third party, and modify your document in any way. If you are writing your own custom widget you can specify what access level it needs as part of the initial ready message. Possible values are: none , read table and full . <script> grist.ready({ requiredAccess: 'read table' }); </script> This directs Grist to request the desired access level from the user. Your widget will be reloaded with the appropriate access level if the user approves the request. If you wish to get notified of the access level, you can subscribe to the onOptions event that is sent to the widget after it tells Grist it is ready: grist.onOptions(function(options, interaction) { console.log(interaction.access_level); }); For now, just skip the options parameter (it will be described in Widget options section). The current access level is part of the second parameter, which describes how Grist will interact with your widget. Invoice example # The minimal example above showed records as plain JSON, but the widget can get as fancy as you like. Here is an example of showing a record as a printable invoice: You can read the details of how to use this widget in our Invoice preparation example . The invoice widget is hosted at: https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/invoices/ And the source HTML/CSS/JS can be browsed at: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget/tree/master/invoices It uses Vue.js and grist.onRecord . Creating a custom widget # As you saw, writing a simple widget that uses data from a table is very easy. First, you need to tell Grist that you are ready and then subscribe to one of the available events: onRecord , onRecords or onOptions . grist.ready(); grist.onRecord(function (record) { // Cursor has moved. }); grist.onRecords(function (record) { // Data in the table has changed. }); grist.onOptions(function (options, interaction) { // Configuration has changed. }); Let\u2019s say you want to build a custom widget that will show an image from a URL and optionally a single line of text below as the image title. You will need to read two values from two columns: Link and Title . You could access those columns directly using literal column names in your script. Here is a complete example of widget source code that will do the job: <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> <img id=\"image\" src=\"\"/> <div id=\"title\"></div> <script> grist.ready({requiredAccess: 'read table'}); grist.onRecord(function (record) { document.getElementById('image').src = record.Link; document.getElementById('title').innerText = record.Title; }); </script> When getting started, this is a good approach, but it has two significant drawbacks. Every time you rename a column, you will also have to change your widget\u2019s source. Moreover, using this widget on a different table or sharing it with your friends can be difficult as column names might be different. To help with this, Grist offers the column mapping API. Column mapping # Instead of using column names directly, you can ask the user to pick which column to use as a Link and Title . The list of expected columns can be sent to Grist as part of the ready call: grist.ready({columns: ['Link', 'Title']}); Using this information, in the creator panel, Grist will hide the regular \u201cVisible\u201d columns section and display specialized column pickers. Your widget will receive this mapping configuration as part of onRecord or onRecords event in the second parameter. You can use this configuration to do the mappings yourself or use the mapColumnNames helper function to do it for you. <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> <img id=\"image\" src=\"\"/> <div id=\"title\"></div> <script> grist.ready({columns: ['Link', 'Title'], requiredAccess: 'read table'}); grist.onRecord(function (record, mappings) { const mapped = grist.mapColumnNames(record); // First check if all columns were mapped. if (mapped) { document.getElementById('image').src = mapped.Link; document.getElementById('title').innerText = mapped.Title; console.log(`Using ${mappings.Link} and ${mappings.Title} columns`); } else { // Helper returned a null value. It means that not all // required columns were mapped. console.error(\"Please map all columns\"); } }); </script> Now, if you rename one of the columns, the widget will still work. You can also use this widget in any other table or share with a friend, as it doesn\u2019t depend on your table structure and can be easily configured. In the configuration used above, we told Grist that all the columns are required, and the user can pick any column even if the column doesn\u2019t contain a text value. To be more precise, we can include more options in the request. For example: grist.ready({columns: [ { name: \"Link\", // What field we will read. title: \"Image link\", // Friendly field name. optional: false, // Is this an optional field. type: \"Text\" // What type of column we expect. description: \"Some text\" // Description of a field. allowMultiple: false // Allows multiple column assignment. } ]}); The optional setting is important for correct operation of the mapColumnNames helper. This helper will return a mapped record only when all required (not optional) columns are picked. By default Grist will allow the user to pick any type of column. To allow only a column of a specific type, you need to set a type property. Here are all valid types: Int ( Integer column ), Numeric ( Numeric column ), Text , Date , DateTime , Bool ( Toggle column ), Choice , ChoiceList , Ref ( Reference column ), RefList ( Reference List ), Attachments . The default value of type is Any , so Grist will allow the user to pick any column type. You can also specify a list of types, for example Date,DateTime . In that case, Grist will allow the user to pick any column that matches one of the types in the list. Use title and description fields to help your users understand what is the purpose of the column. The description will be displayed just below the column name, and the title will be used as a column label. Both are optional and you can put there any text you want. If you need to map multiple columns (for example in a custom chart widget), you can use allowMultiple option. This will allow your users to pick a set of columns that will be returned as list of mapped table column names. The mapColumnNames helper will then return an array of mapped column values in a single field. Suppose the user deletes a column or changes its type so that it will no longer match the type requested by the widget. In that case, Grist will automatically remove this column from the mapping. Widget options # If your widget needs to store some options, Grist offers a simple key-value storage API for you to use. Here are some JavaScript code snippets that show how to interact with this API: // Store a simple text value . await grist.setOption('color', '#FF0000'); // Store complex objects as JSON. await grist.setOption('settings', {lines: 10, skipFirst: true}); // Read previously saved option const color = await grist.getOption('color'); // Clear all options. await grist.clearOptions(); // Get and replace all options. await grist.getOptions(); await grist.setOptions({...}); You can experiment with this yourself. Here is a test widget that demonstrates how to use this API: https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/inspect/onOptions.html When your widget saves or edits some options, the icon on top of the section gets highlighted in green. You can either apply those options to the widget or revert that modification. This allows viewers (users with read-only access) or collaborators to configure your widget without overwriting original settings. This behavior should look familiar to you and others, as this works like sorting and filtering on table or card views. Saving current options you will apply them to the widget and make them available to others. Using this menu, you can also clear all options to revert the widget to its initial state. To do this, press the little trash icon and then Save . Grist will also trigger an event, every time the options are changed (or cleared). Here is how you can subscribe to this event. grist.onOptions(function(options, interaction) { if (options) { console.log('Current color', options.color); } else { // No widget options were saved, fallback to default ones. } }); If you are building your own widget, you generally should not read options directly (using grist.widgetApi.getOption() ). A better pattern is to apply them all when they are changed. Using the onOptions handler will make your widget easier to change and understand later. There is one more scenario to cover. Suppose your widget has some kind of custom configuration screen. In that case, you probably need some button or other UI element that the user can use to show it. This additional UI element will likely be rarely used by you or your collaborators, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to show it all the time. To help with this, Grist offers an additional interaction option you can send as part of the ready message: grist.ready({ onEditOptions: function() { // Your custom logic to open the custom configuration screen. } }); This will tell Grist to display an additional button Open configuration in the creator panel and the section menu. When clicked, it will trigger your handler, which you can use to show your own custom configuration screen. Custom Widget linking # Custom widgets can also be used as a source of linking (see Linking widgets ). All you need to do is inform Grist that your widget supports linking by passing an additional option to the ready call (see Widget API ): grist.ready({ allowSelectBy: true }); This will enable the Select By option in the widget configuration panel. Now you can use your widget to control the cursor position in linked widgets. To do this, you need to call the setCursorPos function: // Inform Grist that the cursor should be moved to the row with id 20. grist.setCursorPos({rowId: 20}); // or inform that your widget is creating a new row. grist.setCursorPos({rowId: 'new'}); Premade Custom Widgets # All premade custom widgets are available in the Custom Widget configuration panel on the right-hand side of the screen under the Custom dropdown. Advanced Charts # The Advanced Charts custom widget gives you more power and flexibility than Grist\u2019s built-in charts, offering a wide variety of chart types as well as increased control over styling and layout. It\u2019s a version of Plotly\u2019s Chart Studio , see their tutorials for more detailed help. You\u2019ll need to set the access level to \u201cFull document access\u201d. Don\u2019t worry, the widget only reads data from the selected table, doesn\u2019t send it to any servers, and doesn\u2019t write or otherwise make changes back to your document. This is what you should see: Click the big blue \u201c+ Trace\u201d button to get started. This will add a panel like the following: Click \u201cScatter\u201d to choose a different chart type such as Bar or Line. Then click the \u201cChoose data\u201d dropdowns to select the columns you want to plot. You can add multiple traces to overlay different plots. Try different panels from the sidebar to customize the chart further. For example, go to Style > Axes > Titles to add a label to each axis. See the chart studio tutorials to learn more. As you customize the widget, remember to regularly click the \u2018Save\u2019 button above the widget to keep your configuration. Copy to clipboard # Copy to clipboard copies a value from the specified column of the selected record. When configuring the widget, you will need to select which column you wish to copy data from. Note that you can also copy data from a selected cell by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C on Windows or \u2318 + C on Mac. To paste, use Ctrl + V or \u2318 + V . You can find an example of the copy to clipboard button in our Webinar 7 (Custom Widgets) template. You can also watch a video walkthrough from our Custom Widgets Webinar . Dropbox Embedder # View and access files saved to dropbox. To start, add a new column to your table to store your dropbox links. Then, add a new custom widget to the page. Choose the data table that contains the dropbox links and \u2018Select By\u2019 that same table. To configure, select \u2018Dropbox Embedder\u2019 from the Custom dropdown and allow access to read the selected table. Under \u2018Dropbox Link\u2019, select the column that contains your dropbox links. You can create links to folders or specific files in Dropbox. Click \u2018Share\u2019 then set permissions for the link. You can choose to allow anyone with the link to view or edit. Create, then copy the link. Paste this link into your Dropbox Link column in Grist. Note that users cannot edit directly in the custom widget even if edit permissions are granted. To edit, select the object in the Dropbox Embedder and it will open in a new tab where it can be edited directly in Dropbox. You can check out an example of the Dropbox Embedder in our Hurricane Preparedness template. Grist Video Player # Embed videos from online sources like YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, Google Drive and more. To start, add a new column to your table to store your video URLs. Then, add a new custom widget to the page. Choose the data table that contains the video URLs and \u2018Select By\u2019 that same table. To configure, select \u2018Grist Video Player\u2019 from the Custom dropdown and allow access to read the selected table. Under \u2018URL\u2019, select the column that contains your video URLs. For most online videos, including YouTube videos and videos stored on Google Drive, you can simply click the \u2018Share\u2019 option and copy the URL. For some other videos, you may see this error: If this happens, you\u2019ll need to take the URL from the Embed code. After clicking the share option on the video, click the option to \u2018Embed\u2019. Then, click to copy the code. The code it gives you will look something like this: Copy the URL that is found between quotes following src . The highlighted portion in the screenshot below is what you would copy for this particular Facebook video. Paste this URL into your URL column in Grist and the video will now appear in the Grist Video Player custom widget. HTML Viewer # The HTML viewer displays HTML written in a cell. For text-editing widgets, check out our Markdown and Notepad custom widgets. To start, add a new column to your table. This will be where you add you write HTML. Then, add a new custom widget to the page. Choose the data table that contains the HTML and \u2018Select By\u2019 that same table. To configure, select \u2018HTML Viewer\u2019 from the Custom dropdown and allow access to read the selected table. Under \u2018HTML\u2019, select the text column that contains your HTML. Your HTML will be viewable in the custom widget. For help on HTML formatting, check out this guide from W3 Schools: HTML Text Formatting You can find an example of the HTML Viewer in our Webinar 7 (Custom Widgets) template. You can also watch a video walkthrough from our Custom Widgets Webinar . Image Viewer # View images from URL. To start, add a new column to your table. This will be where you add the URL for your image. Then, add a new custom widget to the page. Choose the data table that contains the image URL and \u2018Select By\u2019 that same table. To configure, select \u2018Image Viewer\u2019 from the Custom dropdown and allow access to read the selected table. Under \u2018Image URL\u2019, select the column that contains the URLs for your images. To copy the URL for an image, right click on the photo then \u2018Copy image address\u2019. This copies the URL to your clipboard. Paste this URL into your specified column in Grist. Additionally, you can add multiple images for a specific record by adding multiple image URLs, separated by a space or new line, into a single cell. Please note that a comma will not work to separate the links. When multiple image URLs are present, the image viewer custom widget will function as a carousel. Click the arrows to view additional images. For an example of the Image Viewer widget, check out our U.S. National Park Database , and add a park review while you\u2019re there! You can also check out our Meme Generator template for another great example. For a video walkthrough, be sure to watch our Custom Widgets Webinar ! JupyterLite Notebook # This widget lets you run custom Python code in JupyterLite , a version of JupyterLab running entirely in the browser. You can use the full custom widget plugin API and access or modify any data in the document (subject to Access Rules), unlocking nearly unlimited possibilities for advanced users. You\u2019ll be presented with a notebook where you can enter and run Python code, e.g: After typing code in a cell, click the play button or press Shift+Enter to run that cell. Unlike formulas, code isn\u2019t saved automatically. You must press the usual \u2018Save\u2019 button above the widget (outside the notebook) to persist the code within your Grist document. On the other hand, changes to settings within the notebook (e.g. keyboard shortcuts) are saved in your browser\u2019s local storage, so they\u2019re not shared with other users of the document. A special object called grist is automatically available to use in Python code, which mirrors many common methods of the usual JS plugin API . Note that many of these methods are asynchronous, so you should use await before calling them. async fetch_selected_table() : returns the data of the table backing the notebook widget. async fetch_selected_record(row_id=None) : returns a record of the table backing the notebook widget. If row_id is specified, returns the record at that row. Otherwise, returns the record at the current cursor position in a widget linked to the notebook widget. async fetch_table(table_id) : returns the data of the specified table. Note that this differs from fetch_selected_table (even for the same table) in several ways: The widget must have full document access. All columns are included, whereas fetch_selected_table excludes columns that are hidden in the widget configuration. All rows are included, whereas fetch_selected_table takes widget filters and \u2018SELECT BY\u2019 into account. The data is not sorted according to the widget\u2019s configuration. The data is fetched from the server, so the method may be slower. The values for reference columns are row IDs of the referenced table, whereas fetch_selected_table returns the values displayed based on the \u2018SHOW COLUMN\u2019 configuration. on_record(callback) : registers a callback function to run when the cursor moves in a widget linked to the notebook widget, i.e. the widget chosen from the \u201cSELECT BY\u201d dropdown in the Data section of the widget configuration. The callback function will be passed the record at the current cursor position. You can also use this as a decorator, i.e. @grist.on_record . on_records(callback) : similar to on_record , but runs when the source data of the widget changes. The callback function will be passed the same data as returned by fetch_selected_table . get_table(table_id) : returns a TableOperations class similar to the interface in the usual JS plugin API for performing CRUD-style operations on a table. See the plugin API documentation for details on the parameters. The class has the following methods: async create(records, parse_strings=True) async update(records, parse_strings=True) async upsert(records, parse_strings=True, add=True, update=True, on_many=\"first\", allow_empty_require=False) async destroy(row_ids) You can also use grist.raw for direct access to the plugin API, e.g. await grist.raw.docApi.fetchTable(table_id) . This may return raw cell values which you can decode with grist.decode_cell_value(value) . You can use many (but not all) third-party libraries in your notebook such as pandas . Many will be installed automatically when they\u2019re imported. Others will require running %pip install <package name> in a cell, e.g. %pip install pandas . Note that it\u2019s %pip and not !pip as in a regular Jupyter notebook. Map # The custom map widget allows you to display locations using latitude and longitude coordinates. If your data is an address, rather than in lat-long format, Grist can convert the address into lat-long coordinates. If using existing lat-long coordinates, you will need three columns; Name, Longitude and Latitude. If using an address, you will need six columns; Name, Address, Geocode, Longitude, Latitude, and Geocoded Address. Geocode is a toggle type column that should be set to true for any record you wish to convert from address to lat-long coordinates to be shown on the map. If you wish to convert all records, you can make Geocode a formula column with the formula = True . This will mark all records as True. Next, add a new custom widget to the page. Choose the data table that contains the addresses or lat-long coordinates and \u2018Select By\u2019 that same table. To configure, select \u2018Map\u2019 from the Custom dropdown. If you already have lat-long coordinates , you can set your access level to Read selected table . If you are using an address and that needs to be converted into lat-long coordinates, you will need to set your access level to Full document access because the widget needs permission to write to your document in order to add lat-long coordinates. Map all required columns. Note that Name, Longitude and Latitude are labeled as required. Geocode, Address and Geocoded Address are listed as optional. If you are using addresses and need Grist to convert these to lat-long coordinates, you must map all six columns. After mapping the necessary columns and selecting the appropriate Access Level, the map widget will populate. You can configure the map to show only the selected location by clicking the \u2018Open Configuration\u2019 option in the creator panel . Then, uncheck \u2018All Locations\u2019. Click the green check mark at the top of the widget to save the updated configuration settings. Check out our Mapping Locations template or our Crowdsourced List for two great examples! For a video walkthrough, check out our Custom Widgets Webinar . Markdown # The Markdown custom widget allows you to format text using Markdown while displaying the formatted text in an editable widget. For other text-editing widgets, check out our HTML and Notepad custom widgets. To start, add a new column to your table. This will be where you will add your text that will be formatted using Markdown. Then, add a new custom widget to the page. Choose the data table that contains the text formatted with Markdown and \u2018Select By\u2019 that same table. To configure, select \u2018Markdown\u2019 from the Custom dropdown and allow Full document access . Because the widget is also an editor, it needs permission to write to the document. Under \u2018Content\u2019, select the text column that contains Markdown formatting. Any Markdown formatting in the specified text column will apply and be viewable and editable in the custom widget. To edit the text directly in the widget, click the edit icon. The text will revert to display Markdown syntax that can be edited directly in the widget. When in edit mode, the edit icon will be replaced with the save icon. Be sure to click the save icon to save any changes and return to viewing the formatted text. For help on Markdown formatting, check out the Markdown Guide for basic syntax. This guide is also accessible in the Markdown widget by clicking the information icon at the top of the widget. The guide will open in a new tab of your browser for easy reference. You can find an example of the Markdown editor in our Webinar 7 (Custom Widgets) template and check out this video walkthrough from our Custom Widgets Webinar . Notepad # The Notepad custom widget allows you to format text using a rich text editor. For other text-editing widgets, check out our HTML and Markdown custom widgets. To start, add a new column to your table. This will be where details for our formatted text will be stored. Then, add a new custom widget to the page. Choose the data table that contains the column we just added and \u2018Select By\u2019 that same table. To configure, select \u2018Notepad\u2019 from the Custom dropdown and allow Full document access . Because the widget is also an editor, it needs permission to write to the document. Under \u2018Content\u2019, select the column created to store our formatted text. If the text column you chose under Content has existing text, that text will appear in the Notepad widget, ready to be formatted. Use any of the options shown here to format your text. As you can see in the screenshot below, the code for the formatted text is not useful to see in your table. You will edit text directly in the Notepad widget so you can hide this column from your data table. Check out our U.S. National Park Database or our \ud83d\uded2 Grocery List + Meal Planner for two great Notepad examples! You can also check out this video walkthrough from our Custom Widgets Webinar . Print Labels # The Print Labels custom widget allows you to customize and print labels directly from Grist. To start, add a new column to your table. This column will contain the text for the label. Optionally, you can add a second column to specify a label count, allowing you to print more than one of the same label without having to create duplicate records. Next, add a new custom widget to the page. Choose the data table that contains the label details. To configure, select \u2018Print Labels\u2019 from the Custom dropdown and allow access to read the selected table. Under \u2018Label\u2019, select the column that contains the text to include on the labels. If you wish to print more than one of any labels, select the column that contains the number of labels for each record you wish to print. You can select from standard sheet sizes under the dropdown in the upper left of the widget. Be sure to save any changes by clicking the green check mark at the upper right of the widget. To leave any blank labels at the beginning of the sheet, click the settings icon then specify how many labels should be left blank. This is especially helpful if a portion of your label sheet has already been used. You can skip the used labels and begin printing on your first unused label. Check out our Print Mailing Labels template and our Treasure Hunt template for two great examples!

To create a custom widget currently requires knowledge of web development, and access to a public web server (for example, GitHub Pages). A good use for custom widgets is to view records or tables in new ways. Using Grist as your data model and modern HTML/CSS/JS as your view is very powerful.","title":"Page widget: Custom"},{"location":"widget-custom/#minimal-example","text":"To demonstrate to a web developer how custom widgets work, there is a minimal working example at: https://public.getgrist.com/911KcgKA95oQ/Minimal-Custom-Widget/m/fork The example shows a table with some random data (names for pets), and two custom widgets, one showing the selected row in the table as JSON, and the other showing all rows of the table as JSON. If you change data in the table, or move the cursor, the custom widgets update as appropriate. The source code for the widgets is at: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget/tree/master/inspect It is stripped down to the essentials.

Read selected table : the webpage is shown in the widget, and is given read access to the table the widget is configured to select data from. Full document access : the webpage is shown in the widget, and has full access to read and modify the Grist document containing the widget. The webpage should be owned and controlled by you or someone you trust. With Read selected table permissions, a widget could send the data it accesses to a third party. With Full document access permissions, a widget could send all the document data to a third party, and modify your document in any way. If you are writing your own custom widget you can specify what access level it needs as part of the initial ready message. Possible values are: none , read table and full . <script> grist.ready({ requiredAccess: 'read table' }); </script> This directs Grist to request the desired access level from the user. Your widget will be reloaded with the appropriate access level if the user approves the request. If you wish to get notified of the access level, you can subscribe to the onOptions event that is sent to the widget after it tells Grist it is ready: grist.onOptions(function(options, interaction) { console.log(interaction.access_level); }); For now, just skip the options parameter (it will be described in Widget options section).

First, you need to tell Grist that you are ready and then subscribe to one of the available events: onRecord , onRecords or onOptions . grist.ready(); grist.onRecord(function (record) { // Cursor has moved. }); grist.onRecords(function (record) { // Data in the table has changed. }); grist.onOptions(function (options, interaction) { // Configuration has changed. }); Let\u2019s say you want to build a custom widget that will show an image from a URL and optionally a single line of text below as the image title. You will need to read two values from two columns: Link and Title . You could access those columns directly using literal column names in your script. Here is a complete example of widget source code that will do the job: <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> <img id=\"image\" src=\"\"/> <div id=\"title\"></div> <script> grist.ready({requiredAccess: 'read table'}); grist.onRecord(function (record) { document.getElementById('image').src = record.Link; document.getElementById('title').innerText = record.Title; }); </script> When getting started, this is a good approach, but it has two significant drawbacks. Every time you rename a column, you will also have to change your widget\u2019s source. Moreover, using this widget on a different table or sharing it with your friends can be difficult as column names might be different. To help with this, Grist offers the column mapping API.","title":"Creating a custom widget"},{"location":"widget-custom/#column-mapping","text":"Instead of using column names directly, you can ask the user to pick which column to use as a Link and Title . The list of expected columns can be sent to Grist as part of the ready call: grist.ready({columns: ['Link', 'Title']}); Using this information, in the creator panel, Grist will hide the regular \u201cVisible\u201d columns section and display specialized column pickers. Your widget will receive this mapping configuration as part of onRecord or onRecords event in the second parameter. You can use this configuration to do the mappings yourself or use the mapColumnNames helper function to do it for you. <script src=\"https://docs.getgrist.com/grist-plugin-api.js\"></script> <img id=\"image\" src=\"\"/> <div id=\"title\"></div> <script> grist.ready({columns: ['Link', 'Title'], requiredAccess: 'read table'}); grist.onRecord(function (record, mappings) { const mapped = grist.mapColumnNames(record); // First check if all columns were mapped. if (mapped) { document.getElementById('image').src = mapped.Link; document.getElementById('title').innerText = mapped.Title; console.log(`Using ${mappings.Link} and ${mappings.Title} columns`); } else { // Helper returned a null value. It means that not all // required columns were mapped. console.error(\"Please map all columns\"); } }); </script> Now, if you rename one of the columns, the widget will still work. You can also use this widget in any other table or share with a friend, as it doesn\u2019t depend on your table structure and can be easily configured. In the configuration used above, we told Grist that all the columns are required, and the user can pick any column even if the column doesn\u2019t contain a text value. To be more precise, we can include more options in the request. For example: grist.ready({columns: [ { name: \"Link\", // What field we will read. title: \"Image link\", // Friendly field name. optional: false, // Is this an optional field. type: \"Text\" // What type of column we expect. description: \"Some text\" // Description of a field. allowMultiple: false // Allows multiple column assignment. } ]}); The optional setting is important for correct operation of the mapColumnNames helper. This helper will return a mapped record only when all required (not optional) columns are picked. By default Grist will allow the user to pick any type of column. To allow only a column of a specific type, you need to set a type property. Here are all valid types: Int ( Integer column ), Numeric ( Numeric column ), Text , Date , DateTime , Bool ( Toggle column ), Choice , ChoiceList , Ref ( Reference column ), RefList ( Reference List ), Attachments . The default value of type is Any , so Grist will allow the user to pick any column type. You can also specify a list of types, for example Date,DateTime . In that case, Grist will allow the user to pick any column that matches one of the types in the list. Use title and description fields to help your users understand what is the purpose of the column. The description will be displayed just below the column name, and the title will be used as a column label. Both are optional and you can put there any text you want. If you need to map multiple columns (for example in a custom chart widget), you can use allowMultiple option. This will allow your users to pick a set of columns that will be returned as list of mapped table column names. The mapColumnNames helper will then return an array of mapped column values in a single field. Suppose the user deletes a column or changes its type so that it will no longer match the type requested by the widget. In that case, Grist will automatically remove this column from the mapping.","title":"Column mapping"},{"location":"widget-custom/#widget-options","text":"If your widget needs to store some options, Grist offers a simple key-value storage API for you to use. Here are some JavaScript code snippets that show how to interact with this API: // Store a simple text value . await grist.setOption('color', '#FF0000'); // Store complex objects as JSON. await grist.setOption('settings', {lines: 10, skipFirst: true}); // Read previously saved option const color = await grist.getOption('color'); // Clear all options. await grist.clearOptions(); // Get and replace all options. await grist.getOptions(); await grist.setOptions({...}); You can experiment with this yourself. Here is a test widget that demonstrates how to use this API: https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/inspect/onOptions.html When your widget saves or edits some options, the icon on top of the section gets highlighted in green. You can either apply those options to the widget or revert that modification. This allows viewers (users with read-only access) or collaborators to configure your widget without overwriting original settings. This behavior should look familiar to you and others, as this works like sorting and filtering on table or card views. Saving current options you will apply them to the widget and make them available to others. Using this menu, you can also clear all options to revert the widget to its initial state. To do this, press the little trash icon and then Save . Grist will also trigger an event, every time the options are changed (or cleared). Here is how you can subscribe to this event. grist.onOptions(function(options, interaction) { if (options) { console.log('Current color', options.color); } else { // No widget options were saved, fallback to default ones. } }); If you are building your own widget, you generally should not read options directly (using grist.widgetApi.getOption() ). A better pattern is to apply them all when they are changed. Using the onOptions handler will make your widget easier to change and understand later. There is one more scenario to cover. Suppose your widget has some kind of custom configuration screen. In that case, you probably need some button or other UI element that the user can use to show it. This additional UI element will likely be rarely used by you or your collaborators, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to show it all the time. To help with this, Grist offers an additional interaction option you can send as part of the ready message: grist.ready({ onEditOptions: function() { // Your custom logic to open the custom configuration screen. } }); This will tell Grist to display an additional button Open configuration in the creator panel and the section menu. When clicked, it will trigger your handler, which you can use to show your own custom configuration screen.","title":"Widget options"},{"location":"widget-custom/#custom-widget-linking","text":"Custom widgets can also be used as a source of linking (see Linking widgets ).

Now you can use your widget to control the cursor position in linked widgets. To do this, you need to call the setCursorPos function: // Inform Grist that the cursor should be moved to the row with id 20. grist.setCursorPos({rowId: 20}); // or inform that your widget is creating a new row. grist.setCursorPos({rowId: 'new'});","title":"Custom Widget linking"},{"location":"widget-custom/#premade-custom-widgets","text":"All premade custom widgets are available in the Custom Widget configuration panel on the right-hand side of the screen under the Custom dropdown.","title":"Premade Custom Widgets"},{"location":"widget-custom/#advanced-charts","text":"The Advanced Charts custom widget gives you more power and flexibility than Grist\u2019s built-in charts, offering a wide variety of chart types as well as increased control over styling and layout.

You can use the full custom widget plugin API and access or modify any data in the document (subject to Access Rules), unlocking nearly unlimited possibilities for advanced users. You\u2019ll be presented with a notebook where you can enter and run Python code, e.g: After typing code in a cell, click the play button or press Shift+Enter to run that cell. Unlike formulas, code isn\u2019t saved automatically. You must press the usual \u2018Save\u2019 button above the widget (outside the notebook) to persist the code within your Grist document. On the other hand, changes to settings within the notebook (e.g. keyboard shortcuts) are saved in your browser\u2019s local storage, so they\u2019re not shared with other users of the document. A special object called grist is automatically available to use in Python code, which mirrors many common methods of the usual JS plugin API . Note that many of these methods are asynchronous, so you should use await before calling them. async fetch_selected_table() : returns the data of the table backing the notebook widget. async fetch_selected_record(row_id=None) : returns a record of the table backing the notebook widget. If row_id is specified, returns the record at that row. Otherwise, returns the record at the current cursor position in a widget linked to the notebook widget. async fetch_table(table_id) : returns the data of the specified table. Note that this differs from fetch_selected_table (even for the same table) in several ways: The widget must have full document access. All columns are included, whereas fetch_selected_table excludes columns that are hidden in the widget configuration. All rows are included, whereas fetch_selected_table takes widget filters and \u2018SELECT BY\u2019 into account. The data is not sorted according to the widget\u2019s configuration. The data is fetched from the server, so the method may be slower. The values for reference columns are row IDs of the referenced table, whereas fetch_selected_table returns the values displayed based on the \u2018SHOW COLUMN\u2019 configuration. on_record(callback) : registers a callback function to run when the cursor moves in a widget linked to the notebook widget, i.e. the widget chosen from the \u201cSELECT BY\u201d dropdown in the Data section of the widget configuration. The callback function will be passed the record at the current cursor position. You can also use this as a decorator, i.e. @grist.on_record . on_records(callback) : similar to on_record , but runs when the source data of the widget changes. The callback function will be passed the same data as returned by fetch_selected_table . get_table(table_id) : returns a TableOperations class similar to the interface in the usual JS plugin API for performing CRUD-style operations on a table. See the plugin API documentation for details on the parameters. The class has the following methods: async create(records, parse_strings=True) async update(records, parse_strings=True) async upsert(records, parse_strings=True, add=True, update=True, on_many=\"first\", allow_empty_require=False) async destroy(row_ids) You can also use grist.raw for direct access to the plugin API, e.g. await grist.raw.docApi.fetchTable(table_id) . This may return raw cell values which you can decode with grist.decode_cell_value(value) . You can use many (but not all) third-party libraries in your notebook such as pandas . Many will be installed automatically when they\u2019re imported. Others will require running %pip install <package name> in a cell, e.g. %pip install pandas .

If using an address, you will need six columns; Name, Address, Geocode, Longitude, Latitude, and Geocoded Address. Geocode is a toggle type column that should be set to true for any record you wish to convert from address to lat-long coordinates to be shown on the map.

Linking Page Widgets # One big reason for placing more than one widget on a page is that widgets can be linked. When linked, selecting a record in one widget will cause another widget to update and show only the data related to the selected record. For example, let\u2019s say you have a table of Departments in a company, and a table of Employees , with each employee tied to some department. You can have one Table widget listing departments and serving as a selector for a second Table widget listing employees: Previous Next To create this, first create a page with a Table widget for Departments data, as described in Page widgets . Then in the \u201cAdd New\u201d menu, select the \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d option to add another Table widget for Employees data. In the widget picker, use the \u201cSelect By\u201d dropdown and choose the \u201cDEPARTMENTS\u201d widget added in the first step. That\u2019s all it takes: now selecting a department in the first table will cause the second table to show only the employees in that department. Note that this relies on the Employees table having a column of type Reference with the target table of Departments . See Reference columns . Types of linking # Linking widgets only works when there is a relationship between records in the underlying data. There are several kinds of relationships supported. Same-record linking # Most directly you can link two widgets which show data from the same underlying table, usually linking a Table to a Card. This allows you to select a record in the Table widget and see more details of that record in the linked Card widget. For example, you can add a Card of Employees data and link it to an existing Table widget \u201cEMPLOYEES\u201d: When you select a record in the table, the new \u201cEMPLOYEES Card\u201d widget shows a card for the selected record. For another example of such linking, see the \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d document in \u201cExamples & Templates\u201d and the Customizing Layout section in the associated tutorial. Filter linking # As in the Employee-Department example, when one table has a reference to another (i.e. a column of type \u201cReference\u201d), the second table can serve as a selector for the first. Essentially, selecting a record can automatically filter another widget to show only those records that refer to the selected record. In the example shown earlier, the Employees table has a \u201cReference\u201d column pointing to the Departments table, so a list of departments can serve as a selector for employees. When a department is selected, only the employees in that department will be shown. The \u201cLightweight CRM\u201d document in \u201cExamples & Templates\u201d provides another example, where selecting a contact shows only the conversations with that contact. It\u2019s also described in the tutorial . When the target of linking is a Chart widget, you get dynamic charts that reflect data associated with the selected record. For example, you could link a pie chart to a department to show the sum of salaries for each job position in the selected department. Previous Next Indirect linking # Whenever a table A has a reference to B , A can be used in place of B as the source of linking. Instead of considering the currently selected record in A , linking will consider the referenced record in B as the selection. For instance, a Table widget showing Employees can serve as a selector for a Card widget showing data from Departments , using the fact that an employee record contains a \u201cDepartment\u201d reference. In the widget picker, if you select data from Departments , you\u2019ll see a \u201cSelect By\u201d option \u201cEMPLOYEES \u2022 Department\u201d: When you select an employee, you\u2019ll see the details of that employee\u2019s department. Multiple reference columns # When a table that\u2019s the target of linking has multiple reference columns, you may need to choose which one to use for linking. For instance, a Flight record might have fields \u2018DepartureAirport\u2019 and \u2018ArrivalAirport\u2019, each of which is a Reference to the table Airports . When you select an airport in a table, you can have a choice whether to show all flights departing from this airport or all flights arriving to it. The \u201cSelect By\u201d widget will show both options to choose from: Linking summary tables # When widgets display summarized data, as described in Summary tables , they can also be linked to the underlying data, data that references the underlying data, and to other summary tables. For example, you can summarize the table Employees by job position, and include the count of employees for each position, the average salary, or other summary data. You can also link the Employees table to it, so that selecting a position shows all employees in that position. Furthermore, you can link another summary table. For instance, you can summarize employees by position and gender, and link that to the summary by position. When selecting a job position, you can then see a summary by gender for that position. This is also convenient with charts. In this example, you see a pie chart with the average salary for men vs women for the selected job position. As you click different positions, the pie chart updates to reflect the selected one. More examples of such linking can be found in the Analyze and visualize tutorial. Lastly, tables that reference a summary table\u2019s underlying data may now be linked to the summary table itself. In the image below, the Champion Dog\u2019s table has a reference column to the Breeder table. The Breeder table is being summarized in the top right widget by the \u201cCountry\u201d column. Because Champion Dog references Breeder, you may add a widget of Champion Dogs that selects by a summary table of Breeder data. Changing link settings # After a widget is added, you can view and change its link settings from the right panel. One way to get to it is to click on the three-dots icon on the top right of the widget, and click on the \u201cData selection\u201d menu option: This opens the side panel, which shows what data is shown, and which widget, if any, serves as its selector. You can change the \u201cSelect By\u201d setting here, or click the green \u201cEdit Data Selection\u201d button, and change it in the widget picker dialog.","title":"Linking widgets"},{"location":"linking-widgets/#linking-page-widgets","text":"One big reason for placing more than one widget on a page is that widgets can be linked.

For example, you can summarize the table Employees by job position, and include the count of employees for each position, the average salary, or other summary data. You can also link the Employees table to it, so that selecting a position shows all employees in that position. Furthermore, you can link another summary table. For instance, you can summarize employees by position and gender, and link that to the summary by position. When selecting a job position, you can then see a summary by gender for that position. This is also convenient with charts. In this example, you see a pie chart with the average salary for men vs women for the selected job position. As you click different positions, the pie chart updates to reflect the selected one. More examples of such linking can be found in the Analyze and visualize tutorial. Lastly, tables that reference a summary table\u2019s underlying data may now be linked to the summary table itself. In the image below, the Champion Dog\u2019s table has a reference column to the Breeder table. The Breeder table is being summarized in the top right widget by the \u201cCountry\u201d column.

Layout recommendations # While there is no limit to how complicated a layout you can create, you should aim for simple layouts that will be easy to use for your users (even when you are the only user!) One rule of thumb is that a widget controlled by another \u201cselector\u201d widget (see Linking widgets ) should be to the right or below it. Here are some common layouts. Layout: List and detail # The most common one is to have a list of items on the left, with one or more widgets on the right providing more information. For instance, the Lightweight CRM example includes a list of people on the left, with a person\u2019s card and a table of related interactions to the right of the list. In this usage, you might want to include in the list only the minimal information you need, perhaps only a contact\u2019s name. If your table has many columns, a quick way to leave only a few is via the widget options in the right-side panel. In the table widget, click the three-dot menu on the top right, and select \u201cWidget options\u201d. You\u2019ll see a list of \u201cVisible Columns\u201d. Click \u201cSelect all\u201d link on top of that list: Now uncheck the few fields you want to keep, and click \u201cHide columns\u201d to hide the rest. Layout: Spreadsheet plus # Sometimes a wide spreadsheet with many columns is convenient. If you\u2019d like to see more info associated with the rows of this spreadsheet, you can add widgets below it. These could be details linked to the spreadsheet, or summary tables that show totals or other global info. For instance, here is a possible layout based on the Lightweight CRM example. It shows contacts as a wide spreadsheet, and below that includes sections with an overall summary, and interactions for the selected contact. Layout: Summary and details # Sometimes it\u2019s useful to divide up a large dataset into subsets. For instance, you might have credit card transactions, and want a way to view them one month at a time. To do it, you\u2019ll use a \u201cMonth\u201d column, creating one with a formula if needed. Then create a summary table grouped by \u201cMonth\u201d (see Summary tables , and link the table of transactions to it. We can then select a month and see a spreadsheet of only the transactions in that month. Layout: Charts dashboard # If you have many charts, you can just lay them out in a grid to create a top-level dashboard. For dynamic charts in which data is selected by another table, a layout like List-and-detail above would work well. One tip is to include both a Table widget and a Chart widget, configured and linked the same way, and differing only in the widget type: Having a table alongside the chart can be a useful reference, as well as provide more context to what is visible in the chart.","title":"Custom layouts"},{"location":"custom-layouts/#custom-layouts","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

Mais la bonne nouvelle est que vous pouvez rejoindre la communaut\u00e9 de traduction pour nous aider \ud83d\udc4b . Summary tables are the workhorse of data analysis in Grist. They are similar to \u201cpivot tables\u201d in spreadsheets, and to GROUP BY clauses in databases. They let you get table-wide totals or any subtotals. Summary tables have many uses: Group projects by status, or by priority. Summarize bank transactions by year, or quarter, or by category. Group employees by position, or gender, or department. Summarize by any combination, such as position and gender and department. Group all records to calculate table-wide totals and statistics. Adding summaries # Click \u201cAdd New\u201d button and select \u201cAdd Page\u201d or \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In the widget picker, click the summation icon ( ) next to the table you\u2019d like to summarize. When creating a summary table, you choose a field or a combination of fields by which data should be grouped. These are called the \u201cGroup by\u201d fields. The summary table will contain one row for each group-by value. For instance, if \u201cPosition\u201d is selected as a group-by field, the summary table will contain one row for each job position. Grist\u2019s powerful formulas then allow arbitrary calculations on the matching subsets of the underlying data. Keep in mind that the group-by fields determine which groups should exist in the summary table. Do not select values you\u2019d like to calculate (e.g. for average salary) as group-by fields; these will be created using formulas in the next step. Tip: You can think of rows in a summary table as buckets into which your records will be placed. Group-by fields determine the labels for these buckets. For instance, a summary of projects grouped by status (e.g. \u201cActive\u201d, \u201cCompleted\u201d, \u201cNotStarted\u201d) will have three such buckets, one for each status. Every project goes into one of these three buckets. You can then easily calculate info for each folder, such as a count of projects or the total of their costs. Summary formulas # When you add a summary table, each of the selected group-by fields becomes a column in the new table. Everything else in the summary table is calculated using formula columns. Some of these columns are created automatically, as a convenience. Specifically, a column count will be added to show the number of records in the group represented by the current summary row. And for any numerical column in the original data, the summary table will contain a same-named column with the total. For instance, the summary of Employees grouped by Position would look like this: Tip: A summary widget will have a header like \u201cEMPLOYEES [by Position]\u201d, to indicate that it\u2019s showing summary data for the Employees table, grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d. You can click the title to rename it. If you select a cell in a column like count or AnnualPay and hit Enter , you\u2019ll see the formulas that calculate them: count is len($group) AnnualPay is SUM($group.AnnualPay) The mysterious $group is simply another column, hidden by default (but you may unhide it). It contains for each cell the group of records represented by this summary row. Side note for Python fans. $group is a special Python object. It\u2019s an iterable collection of records. Using an attribute like $group.A is a shorthand for the list of values in the A column of all the records in the group, similar to [r.A for r in $group] . If you unhide this column, it will show as a python list of numeric row IDs which identify the records in the group. Sometimes the automatically created columns don\u2019t make sense. For instance, the sum of PayRate isn\u2019t very meaningful. Simply delete such columns, either using the column menu or using the Alt + Minus keyboard shortcut. You are free to change formulas for the automatically created columns, or to add new formula columns. Note that summary tables do not allow adding non -formula columns. For instance, you might want to change the formula for PayRate from SUM($group.PayRate) to AVERAGE($group.PayRate) , which would be a more interesting value. Here are some useful recipes of formulas in summary tables: Average : AVERAGE($group.PayRate) or SUM($group.PayRate) / $count Standard deviation : STDEV($group.PayRate) Maximum or minimum : MAX($group.PayRate) , MIN($group.PayRate) Sum over a subset of records : SUM(r.AnnualPay for r in $group if r.EmploymentStatus == \"Active\") Weighted average : AVERAGE_WEIGHTED(zip($group.Life_Expectancy, $group.Population)) In fact, you may use the full power of Python to calculate what you\u2019d like. As for any table, your formula may refer to any of the columns in the summary table, not only $group . Changing summary columns # The group-by columns in a summary table are created when you add the widget. It\u2019s not possible to modify the values in them, or to modify their settings, such as type. The settings and values of the group-by columns reflect those in the underlying table. When new values appear in the underlying table for the group-by columns, the summary tables will also get new rows automatically. What you may change is which columns the table is grouped by. Click the three dots on the top right of the summary table, and click \u201cData selection\u201d: The settings in the side pane tell you which data is shown and how it\u2019s grouped: You can click \u201cEdit Data Selection\u201d button to open the same widget picker that you used to add the summary table. You can now deselect some \u201cGroup by\u201d fields and select others, and click \u201cSave\u201d to update the summary table. Linking summary tables # You can link summary tables to other widgets. If you have a summary table on a page, it can be used as a selector for a table of underlying data, or for a more detailed summary. For example, if you have a summary of Employees by \u201cPosition\u201d, it will be available as a \u201cSELECT BY\u201d option when adding an unsummarized table of Employees : The result is that you can select a position in the summary table, and see all employees in that position. You could similarly link a summary of Employees grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d and \u201cGender\u201d to the first widget: You can then select a position in the \u201cEmployees [by Position]\u201d widget, and see a breakdown by gender among the employees in that position. Note that such linking requires the new widget to include both \u201cPosition\u201d and \u201cGender\u201d in its group-by columns. For more about linking, see Linking widgets . Charting summarized data # Summary tables are a great source of data for charts, including dynamic charts. In the example above, we could add another widget showing Employees grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d and \u201cGender\u201d, but this time in a Chart widget. Select \u201cBar Chart\u201d for the chart type, and select \u201cGender\u201d and \u201cAnnualPay\u201d as Visible Series. You can now click on a position, and see visually the gender difference in average salary for this position. The Analyze and visualize tutorial shows other examples of charts based on summary tables. Detaching summary tables # Summary tables are computed from underlying data. Sometimes, however, its useful to \u201cdetach\u201d a summary table and turn it into an independent data table. For example, we\u2019ve seen how to summarize a table of Employees , grouping it by the column \u201cPosition\u201d. Let\u2019s say you want to associate some data with each position, such as a job description, or a workers compensation insurance code. Such data belongs in its own table, with one row for each position, and a few columns. Summary tables provide an easy way to create such a table. Add a page with a summary of Employees grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d. Now, in the right panel\u2019s \u201cData\u201d tab, click the \u201cDetach\u201d button. Your summary table just got turned into a brand new table with the same rows and an auto-generated name, like \u201cTable1\u201d. You can rename it to \u201cPositions\u201d, and add the columns you need: The calculated columns remain. In fact, anything you could calculate about each position in the \u201cEmployees [by Position]\u201d summary table, you may still calculate in the new \u201cPositions\u201d table. One difference is that new values will not get added to the detached table automatically. In other words, if a never-before-seen position (perhaps \u201cChief Troublemaker\u201d) appears in the underlying data, a summary table would update automatically to include it, but a detached table will not.","title":"Summary tables"},{"location":"summary-tables/#summary-tables","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

Sometimes, however, its useful to \u201cdetach\u201d a summary table and turn it into an independent data table. For example, we\u2019ve seen how to summarize a table of Employees , grouping it by the column \u201cPosition\u201d. Let\u2019s say you want to associate some data with each position, such as a job description, or a workers compensation insurance code. Such data belongs in its own table, with one row for each position, and a few columns. Summary tables provide an easy way to create such a table. Add a page with a summary of Employees grouped by \u201cPosition\u201d. Now, in the right panel\u2019s \u201cData\u201d tab, click the \u201cDetach\u201d button. Your summary table just got turned into a brand new table with the same rows and an auto-generated name, like \u201cTable1\u201d. You can rename it to \u201cPositions\u201d, and add the columns you need: The calculated columns remain. In fact, anything you could calculate about each position in the \u201cEmployees [by Position]\u201d summary table, you may still calculate in the new \u201cPositions\u201d table. One difference is that new values will not get added to the detached table automatically. In other words, if a never-before-seen position (perhaps \u201cChief Troublemaker\u201d) appears in the underlying data, a summary table would update automatically to include it, but a detached table will not.","title":"Detaching summary tables"},{"location":"on-demand-tables/","text":"On-Demand Tables # Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

Specifying a type # Grist columns have types, similar to other spreadsheets or databases. The type of a column controls its appearance and the help Grist will offer you when editing cells. When you create a new column, it initially has the Any type. When you enter the column\u2019s first cell, Grist tries to narrow this type. If you enter a number, the column will be changed to Numeric type, which is right-aligned by default. If you enter something that doesn\u2019t look like a number, the column will be changed to Text type, which is left-aligned by default. To inspect the type of a column, hover over the column header, then click on the drop-down, then select \u201cColumn Options\u201d. The \u201cColumn Type\u201d section is what you are looking for. You will often want to control the column type manually. You can change it in the \u201cColumn Type\u201d section. For example, here we set a column full of \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d responses to be of type Toggle : One advantage of doing so is that Grist can now offer you ways to visualize the column that are specialized to on/off style values. Each column type has different options in the \u201cCell Format\u201d section of the side panel: Regardless of the column type, you can enter any value in cells. If a value entered is incompatible with the defined type, the cell will be highlighted with an error (and columns referencing the invalid value will also display an error): Supported types # Grist supports the following types: Type Description Text ( Default ) Any string of text. Numeric Floating point numbers. Integer Integers (whole numbers). Toggle Boolean (True / False) Date Valid date (without a time component). DateTime Valid date + time. Choice Single value from a list of pre-defined valid values. Choice List Multiple values from a list of pre-defined valid values. Reference A reference column to another table. Reference List A list of references to another table. Attachment Cells where you can place files or images. Text columns # You can put any text you like in this type of column. For formatting, you can control alignment and word-wrap, text color and background color. If the column is used for storing web links, you can turn on \u201cHyperLink\u201d formatting to make links prettier and to include a clickable link icon. Hyperlinks # When a Text column uses \u201cHyperLink\u201d formatting, values get formatted like so: https://getgrist.com will show https://getgrist.com . Grist Labs https://getgrist.com will show Grist Labs (linking to \u201chttps://getgrist.com\u201d with \u201cGrist Labs\u201d as the text). Email Help mailto:support@getgrist.com will show Email Help , a link which would open an email program to compose an email to support@getgrist.com. In general, the value until the last space is used as the link text, while the last word is used as the link destination. Link formatting is particularly useful when links are generated using a formula such as: $Company + \" \" + $Website Numeric columns # This type is for numbers, including floating-point numbers. In addition to controlling alignment and color, you can choose the number format, and the minimum and maximum number of digits to show after the decimal point. Choosing the \u201cSpinner\u201d option for CELL FORMAT will show arrows in each cell for increasing/decreasing the number. The options under NUMBER FORMAT include: $ : Format for currency amounts, such as dollars or euro. Selecting the $ will add a currency prefix, thousands separators, and default to 2 digits after the decimal point. It will also open a currency selector for international currencies. Setting Default Currency You can set a document\u2019s default timezone, locale, and currency in Document Settings . , : Turn on the display of thousands separators. % : Show numbers as percentages. E.g. \u201c0.5\u201d would show as \u201c50%\u201d. Exp : Show numbers in exponential (or scientific) notation. E.g. \u201c1234\u201d would be shown as \u201c1.234E3\u201d. (-) : Show negative numbers in parentheses, without a leading minus sign. This is commonly used in accounting, and usually combined with $ or , formats. Integer columns # This is strictly for whole numbers. It has the same options as the numeric type. Toggle columns # This type is for storing true/false values. The values can be shown as text, checkboxes, or switches. See also example in Specifying a type . Date columns # This type is for storing calendar dates (without a time of day component). More details in Working with dates . You can choose the format for dates, see the date formatting reference . DateTime columns # This type is for storing calendar dates plus time of day. More details in Working with dates . You can choose the format for dates, see the date and time formatting reference . You can also specify the timezone to display for. If you\u2019d like to set a default timezone for your document, you can do so in Document Settings . Choice columns # This type is for storing one of a set of valid values, where you get to specify the available values. There\u2019s an example of using this type of column in the Lightweight CRM example . If you start off with a populated text column, Grist will take all unique values from that column as the valid choices. You can add or remove choices by either clicking Edit or on the Choices box. To add a choice, type its value in the text field below the other choices and press Enter . To remove a choice, click the delete icon to the right of the choice or select the choice by clicking on it, and then press Backspace / Delete . To apply/save your changes, you can either click the Save button or press Enter . To discard your changes, you can either click the Cancel button or press Escape . Clicking the color dropdown to the left of a choice will open a color picker for customizing the fill and text color of a choice. Changes to colors are reflected inside cells and throughout the rest of your document once you save your changes. Choices can be re-arranged by clicking and dragging them, which determines the order in which they appear when typing into a cell. You can also rename a choice by clicking on it and typing a new name. Renaming a choice will also rename all the values that are used in your document. The configuration editor supports many convenient keyboard shortcuts. You can press the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to navigate between selected choices; hold the Shift key to bulk select adjacent choices while clicking or using the arrow keys; and hold the Command / Control key to multi-select choices while clicking. To select all choices, you can press Command / Control + A . Undo and redo are also supported in the configuration editor. While your cursor has focus on the editor text field, you can press Command / Control + Z to undo your last change, and Command / Control + Shift + Z to redo it. The configuration editor also supports copy and paste. To copy, select the choices you want copied and press Command / Control + C . To paste, focus on the text field and press Command / Control + V . Choices are pasted in bulk if the clipboard contains multiple lines of text. Choices can also be copied from one column\u2019s configuration editor and pasted into another, which will copy over both the values and their configured colors. When typing into a Choice column cell, your configured choices will be shown in an autocomplete menu. You can either click on a choice, or use the arrow keys and Enter to add a choice to a cell. If your input is not one of the valid choices, Grist will display a menu option for conveniently adding it as a valid choice and into the cell in one step. Choice List columns # This type is for storing multiple values from a set of valid values, where you get to specify the available values. If you start off with a populated text column, Grist will take all unique values from that column as the valid choices. Choice List columns are configured the same way Choice columns are, and support the same level of customization and keyboard shortcuts. They differ in the number of choices they allow to be entered in each cell. While Choice columns only allow at most one value in a cell, Choice List columns allow many. Like with Choice columns, when typing into a Choice List column cell, the valid choices will be shown in an autocomplete menu. Once you\u2019ve selected a value, you can continue adding choices to the same cell. Choices can be re-arranged inside their cells by clicking and dragging them while the cell is being edited. You can also use the arrow keys and the Delete key to navigate and delete choices, or simply click the delete icon when hovering your cursor over a choice. Filtering Choice and Choice List columns\u2019 dropdown lists When entering data into a Choice or Choice List column you will see a dropdown list of all available choices. Sometimes it would be useful to filter the dropdown list based on a condition, such as the value in another cell. Writing conditions to filter choice dropdown lists is similar to filtering reference column\u2019s dropdown lists . Reference columns # This sets up a cross-reference to another table. You can specify the table to reference, and a column within that table to show. There\u2019s a lot you can do with this kind of column, see Reference columns for details. Reference List columns # Like Reference columns , but can store multiple references in a single cell. There\u2019s a lot you can do with this kind of column, see Reference columns for details. Attachment columns # This column type lets you insert entire files and images in cells. When images are added in cells, a preview thumbnail is shown in the cell. The \u201cSize\u201d bar gives control of the scale of this thumbnail. When you create an attachment column, cells of that column will have a paperclip icon: When you click on a paperclip icon, you can select a file to attach. If it is an image, you\u2019ll see a thumbnail of it in the cell. If you hover over the image, you\u2019ll see a paperclip icon again, which you can use to add more files to the same cell. You\u2019ll also see an \u201copen-eye\u201d icon, which when clicked brings up a larger view of all of the cell\u2019s attachments, and gives you a way to rename them, download them, or remove them.","title":"Columns & types"},{"location":"col-types/#columns-and-data-types","text":"","title":"Columns and data types"},{"location":"col-types/#adding-and-removing-columns","text":"Every Grist table, when first created, has three columns called A, B, and C.

Reference and Reference Lists # Overview # Reference and Reference List columns in Grist allow one table to create an explicit reference to another. In the database world this is similar to a foreign key. In the spreadsheet world this is similar to a VLOOKUP , but much more powerful and easier to use. In this guide we\u2019ll use the term underlying table for the table that lists all available values, and referencing table for the table that uses those values. Creating a new Reference column # Suppose we have a document with two tables, Clients and Projects. The Clients table lists our clients - names, contacts, signing dates - and the Projects table lists projects we do for clients. There are all sorts of things Grist can do for us if we let it know that the Client column in the Projects table is referring to clients listed in the Clients table. We can do this by converting the Client column to a \u201creference column\u201d. Open the Column Options side panel (see Specifying a type ) and set the \u201cColumn Type\u201d to \u201cReference\u201d. Adjust the \u201cData from Table\u201d option to be the correct table you want to cross-reference, and the \u201cShow Column\u201d option to match which column of that table you\u2019d like to show. Then hit \u201cApply\u201d when you\u2019re happy with the result. Understanding the reference The column value always references the entire record in the underlying table. The displayed value can be any column from that record, as selected in Show Column . You can also include additional columns to display as explained later. In our example, you can see little link icons appearing in the Client column cells, showing that they have been successfully cross-referenced with the Clients table. Once the column type is set, you can start typing into it or double-click it to see a dropdown list of all available values. Note that the table Clients and the column Client are related by the column type rather than by name. They can be named anything. Spotting reference columns You can tell that the values in a column represent a reference by the link icon that appears next to the values. If you accidentally type in a value that is not present in the Clients table, its value will be highlighted as invalid: Adding values to a Reference column # Sometimes it\u2019s useful to add a new value to the dropdown list without having to switch to the underlying table. Reference columns make it easy! Just type in the value you want add and select the + value in the dropdown list. Grist will automatically add a new record containing this value to the underlying table and insert the proper reference: Converting Text column to Reference # When working with existing data, it\u2019s common to have existing text values that should really be reference values. Don\u2019t worry, conversion is simple! Just change the column type to Reference and Grist will automatically find and substitute matching values for references. If some values are not found, they\u2019ll be shown as invalid. You can then either add them to the underlying table or select the proper values for them. In this example, the first three values match perfectly, but Forest Labs is invalid because it doesn\u2019t exist in the Clients table: Including multiple fields from a reference # A big benefit of reference columns is that they allow you to easily bring in multiple columns from the underlying table. In our example, if you wanted to bring in $Client.Contact to the Projects table, you can just select the Contact column from the Add Referenced Columns section and it will be automatically added to the Projects table: If you\u2019re comfortable using formulas, you can see that the added column is just the formula =$Client.Contact . If you were so inclined, you could achieve the same result by manually adding the formula column. You can also use any other fields from Clients table by referencing $Client in formulas in the Projects table. Note that in formulas, we use the name of the reference column ( $Client ) to refer to a linked record, not the name of the table (which is Clients here). Don\u2019t let the similarity of the names in this example confuse you. Using references in formulas You may have noticed that the underlying table is Clients (plural) but the formula is $Client.Contact (singular). That\u2019s because the formula refers to the referencing column, not the underlying table. In our example, the referencing column is Client . Creating a new Reference List column # So far our example has only dealt with projects that have a single client. Suppose that we also have projects with multiple clients, and we\u2019d like to maintain references to them all from the Client column of the Projects table. We can let Grist know that the Client column contains multiple references by changing its type to \u201cReference List\u201d. This column type can reference multiple records, and can also be thought of as a multi-select. Open the Column Options side panel (see Specifying a type ) and set the \u201cColumn Type\u201d of Client to \u201cReference List\u201d. Grist will automatically convert any of your existing references to reference lists. Once you\u2019re happy with the result, just hit \u201cApply\u201d and the Client column will be ready to accept as many clients as your projects need. Editing values in a Reference List column # To make changes to a Reference List cell, simply double-click the cell or press the Enter key after you have selected the cell you want to edit. You can also start typing after selecting a cell if you\u2019d like to write over any existing contents. Doing so will open an editor like the one in the example below. Like with Reference columns, the autocomplete menu will populate with suggestions as you type. If you type in a value that\u2019s not present in the referenced table, you can select the + value to add a new row to the referenced table with your value. To delete existing references, simply press the Backspace key, or move your cursor over a reference and click the X icon. You can also rearrange references in the editor by dragging them with your mouse. To save your changes and close the editor, either press Enter or Tab , or click anywhere outside the editor. To close the editor and discard any changes you\u2019ve made, press Escape . Understanding reference columns # Cells in a reference column always identify an entire record in the referenced table. For convenience, you may select which column from that record to show by setting the \u201cSHOW COLUMN\u201d. However, the cell\u2019s value is always a record\u2019s unique ID. Similarly, Reference Lists store a list of record ids. What does that really mean? Let\u2019s take a look at the Class Enrollment template. In the Classes table, the Instructor column is a reference column that references data from the Staff table. Full Name is selected under \u2018Show Column\u2019 and is used as a label to represent the record from the Staff table that is being referenced here. We can change that label to any other value contained within the record. Let\u2019s change it to \u2018Row ID\u2019. The row ID is what is actually being stored within the Reference or Reference List column. With this ID, we can fetch any data associated with this record. In the first row of the Classes table, we see Staff[2] as the value in the Instructor column. This represents the record in the Staff table with Row ID = 2 . We can navigate to the Staff table and see which record is assigned Row ID = 2 . To view a record\u2019s unique ID, add a new column with the formula = $id . We can see that the value in the Full Name column for the record with Row ID = 2 is Dowbakin, Daniella . If we revert back to our original settings for the Instructor column of the Classes table, where Full Name was selected under Show Column, we see that the Full Name value associated with Staff[2] is Dowbakin, Daniella . Filtering Reference choices in dropdown # When entering data into a reference column you will see a dropdown list of all available values to choose from. Sometimes the list can get long, and in some cases confusing. For example, say you\u2019re tracking population changes in the 1,000 most populous world cities. When entering a city into the reference column for city selection, the dropdown lists all 1,000 cities. It would be useful if the dropdown list of city choices were filtered based on the country selected in the Country column. To filter a reference column\u2019s dropdown list, select the reference column then set a \u201cDropdown Condition\u201c in the Creator Panel under the \u201cColumn\u201d tab. You can filter a dropdown\u2019s choice by writing a condition as a formula. The attribute choice refers to choices in the dropdown. In this case the formula is choice.Country == $Country . Why did that work? The city column is a reference column pointing to a Cities table that matches countries and cities. That table looks like this. The formula condition choice.Country == $Country is looking up each choice\u2019s country in the Cities table using a reference lookup , then it compares those countries to the value entered in the Country column of the Population Rankings table. The dropdown now lists only choices (aka cities) whose country equals the country entered in Country column. The choice attribute can also be used when setting dropdown filter conditions for Choice and Choice List columns. Note that because reference dropdown filtering is written as formulas, filtering can be very flexible and granular. Users experienced with access rules may notice similarities in how to think about writing these formulas.","title":"Reference columns"},{"location":"col-refs/#reference-and-reference-lists","text":"","title":"Reference and Reference Lists"},{"location":"col-refs/#overview","text":"Reference and Reference List columns in Grist allow one table to create an explicit reference to another.

Formulas # Grist has a powerful data engine to calculate the cells of your tables using formulas. It even has an AI Formula Assistant to help write formulas. If you\u2019ve used spreadsheets before, or database expressions, you\u2019ll be on familiar territory - but there are some wrinkles you\u2019ll want to know about, so hang around. Let\u2019s start with a classic use of spreadsheets. Suppose you have a list of products you\u2019ve ordered, the quantity you ordered, and the unit price of each. You\u2019ve made a column to show the quantity times the unit price, but want the computer to do that part for you. Just select a cell in the column you want to fill, and hit = key to tell Grist you want to enter a formula, rather than a value. Did you notice, when you did that, the labels of the columns changed a little? \u201cProduct\u201d became \u201c$Product\u201d, and \u201cUnit Price\u201d became \u201c$Unit_Price\u201d. This is Grist telling you how to refer to those columns in your formula. Just type $Quantity * $Unit_Price . You\u2019ll find an auto-complete feature ready to help you. Or if you don\u2019t like typing, click on the Quantity column, type the multiplication symbol, and then click on the Unit Price column. Your formula should look like this: To control the column ID, like \u201c$Unit_Price\u201d, that\u2019s used in formulas, see Renaming columns . Press Enter , and your formula is applied to all cells in the column. If you\u2019ve worked with spreadsheets before, you may be surprised that you don\u2019t need to specify row numbers, like B1 * C1 . In Grist, a single formula applies to a whole column. You don\u2019t have to worry about filling it in for all rows, and can refer to values in the same row without fuss. You can format numeric columns to look better by setting column type to Numeric , and selecting suitable formatting options: Column behavior # When we provide a formula for a column we tell Grist to update its value on every change in a document. We can no longer type a value into the cell, because its value is determined purely by the formula. A formula column is one of three possible column behaviors, which you can control using the COLUMN BEHAVIOR section in the creator panel: Data column maintains data, which you can manually update or clear, or optionally calculate using trigger formulas . Formula column always reflects the result of formula calculation, and is kept up-to-date by Grist. Empty column is a state for a new column. Typing any value into it will turn it into a Data Column, while typing in a formula will turn it into a Formula Column Using the COLUMN BEHAVIOR section, you can manually change the column behavior. The most common options are available as green action buttons at the bottom, and other options are available under the behavior menu. Depending on the current column behavior, those are: Set formula action converts an empty column to a formula column. Set trigger formula or Convert to trigger formula action sets a trigger on a column (more on triggers in the next Trigger formulas section ). Make into data column action converts an empty column to a regular data column. Convert column to data converts a formula column to regular data column (you can read more about this feature in the Freeze a formula column section ). Clear and make into formula clears all the data in a column and converts it to a formula column. (We say \u201cclear\u201d as a reminder that existing data in the column will be lost. They\u2019ll be replaced by the calculation results from the formula.) Clear and reset clears all data and completely resets the column to its initial Empty Column state. Python # Grist formulas are written in Python, the most popular language for data science. The entirety of Python\u2019s standard library is available to you. For those with a spreadsheet background, we\u2019ve also added a suite of Excel-like functions, with all-uppercase names. Here\u2019s the full list of functions . Grist documents may use Python 2 or Python 3, see our Python guide for details. Formulas that operate over many rows # If you are a spreadsheet user, you may find yourself wanting to have some special rows at the end of your table that have formulas different to the rest. In Grist, we\u2019d like you to consider adding a widget to your page instead. For common use cases, Summary tables may be exactly what you need. Or if you want to set things up yourself, you can add an extra table widget like this (see Page widgets for details): This is just another table, giving us a place to put formulas outside of the structure of the Materials table. For example, if we wanted to count how many products there are in that table, we could use this formula: len(Materials.all) Every table in your document is available by its name in formulas, as a UserTable . This formula uses the all method to access the rows of the table, but doesn\u2019t do anything with them but count them. Here\u2019s a formula to compute the average price, using the Excel-like function AVERAGE : AVERAGE(Materials.all.Price) The all method returns a RecordSet , which supports iterating over individual columns this way. Equivalently, we could use a Python list comprehension : AVERAGE(material.Price for material in Materials.all) If you are not familiar with Python, it is worth following a tutorial. There are thousands online, including this official one . Python will be useful to you for all sorts of data work, not just Grist. List comprehension is useful once we\u2019re doing anything nuanced. For example, here\u2019s a formula to list the names of products with a quantity greater than 80: [m.Product for m in Materials.all if m.Quantity > 80] This is a list comprehension, but now with a conditional. The result is a list, which is rendered as text in a cell. Python can help in other ways in your search for rows. For example, here\u2019s a formula to find the name of the product with the highest quantity: max(Materials.all, key=lambda m: m.Quantity).Product Formulas are case-sensitive, with Excel-like functions being all-caps ( MAX ), and regular Python generally all lowercase ( max ). For exact matches, there is a shortcut to avoid iteration called lookupRecords , or lookupOne for single matches. Just pass the the values of columns you require to be matched. For example, here is a formula to look up the product name of a material with a quantity of 52: Materials.lookupOne(Quantity=52).Product For very large tables, it is wise to use lookups as much as you can, rather than iterating through rows. Returning to our example document, you can now see how we calculated the Total Spent , Average Quantity , and Most Ordered Product columns: Column Formula Total Spent SUM(Materials.all.Price) Average Quantity AVERAGE(Materials.all.Quantity) Most Ordered Product max(Materials.all, key=lambda m: m.Quantity).Product Separating out calculations like this from the body of your data can take some getting used to, but working this way can help keep your document more organized. And it brings other advantages. For example we could switch the formatting of the summary widget via the side panel: Varying formula by row # Having a formula apply to all rows is convenient and reduces the changes of mistakes. If you need to have a column change its behavior on different rows, it is possible using a conditional in the formula. For example, here is a replacement for the Materials.Price formula that ignores the price and shows zero for products whose name ends in \u201c(Sample)\u201d: if $Product.endswith(\"(Sample)\"): return 0 else: return $Quantity * $Unit_Price Code viewer # Once you have a lot of formulas, or if you have been invited to a document and want to get an overview of its formulas, there is a code viewer available with a pure Python summary of the document. Special values available in formulas # For those familiar with Python, here are the extra values available to you in Grist: rec is the current row. The $column syntax is shorthand for rec.column . The rec variable is of type Record . table is the current table, and is of type UserTable . Tables in your document are available by their name, and are also of type UserTable . Many extra spreadsheet functions are available, see the full function list . If your table or column has a space in its name, or other characters that are awkward in Python, those characters are replaced with an underscore. Auto-complete may help you if you\u2019re not sure. You can also control the \u201cids\u201d of columns and tables in the right side panel. Freeze a formula column # If you\u2019d like to save the output of your formula as plain values, you can simply change column behavior from Formula Column to Data Column . First open the column options in the side panel: Now click on the Formula Column and select Convert column to data option. Notice that there is no = sign in the column cells any more, showing that it is no longer a formula. The cells will no longer change if other cells they used to depend on change. The original formula is saved but stays inactive. It may come useful again if you wish to convert the column back to a formula column, or use it as a Trigger Formula . The side panel has lots of other handy settings, such as cell formatting (number of digits after decimal point, color, etc). The options apply just as much to formula columns as to regular columns. Lookups # Grist functions lookupOne and lookupRecords are useful for enumerating subsets of your data. For example, suppose we added a Category column to our Materials table, and wished to list all products belonging to a specific category. We can do this using TABLE.lookupRecords , where TABLE is the table of interest, and supplying it with the column values to match. For example, Materials.lookupRecords(Category='Ship') , as here: If you are following on, see Adding a field for details of how to add a new field to a card. If you care about the order of results, lookupRecords takes an optional sort_by parameter. For example, we could use this formula to sort by the product name itself: Materials.lookupRecords(Category='Ship', sort_by='Product').Product If you want to sort by multiple columns, remember that you can create a hidden formula column that combines data in any way you like, and then sort by that. The order of records returned by lookupRecords may not match the order of rows you see in a table. To get that order, use sort_by='manualSort' . This is an internal column that is updated with the manually established sort order of rows. If you find yourself doing a lot of look-ups, please consider whether Summary tables and Summary formulas might be what you are looking for. Recursion # Lookups are handy for recursive formulas. Suppose we have a table counting how many events we have per day, and want to add a cumulative sum of those event counts. One way to do that is with a formula like this: yesterday = Events.lookupOne(date=$date - datetime.timedelta(days=1)) $events + (yesterday.cumulative or 0) For clarity, we\u2019ve split this formula into two lines. The first line makes a variable pointing to the row of the day before. The second line computes the value we want in the cell. Python note: the value of the last line is automatically returned (you could prefix it with return if you like). Notice the yesterday.cumulative or 0 . For the earliest row in the table, there will be no yesterday. In this case, lookupOne returns a special empty record, for which yesterday.cumulative will be None . If you\u2019d like to simplify this formula, or find yourself using the same lookup in multiple formulas, it would be worth making yesterday a reference column . Simply add a reference column, and give a formula for it that matches how we defined yesterday here. To actually enter this formula in a cell, you\u2019d use Shift + Enter to divide the lines. Trigger Formulas # Formula columns are great for calculated values \u2013 those determined by other data in the document. It may also be useful to store independent data in a column, but still use a formula to calculate it in some situations. This is exactly what Trigger Formulas offer. It is a very powerful feature that allows you to create a Timestamp or Authorship column, recalculate your data based on a set of conditions that you decide , clean data when a new value is entered, or provide sensible default value for a column. To create a Trigger Formula column, you first need to open the creator panel and click on the Set trigger formula action. If you want to convert an existing formula, use the Convert to trigger formula action available in the COLUMN BEHAVIOR section. To control when the formula is evaluated, use the two checkbox options below: Apply to new records triggers the formula only when a new record is created (a default cell value). Apply on record changes triggers the formula when a record is updated. Applying to new records is self-explanatory, the formula will be evaluated only once when you add a new record. It is a perfect solution to provide default values to the empty cells. Second option allows you to fine grain the conditions and specify which columns, when updated, will trigger the evaluation: You probably noticed the first option Current field . At first glance, you probably wonder: \u201cWhy would I want to trigger the column on its own change?\u201d. This option allows you to react to a value that is being entered into the column, just before it is saved! In the formula editor, you have access to two variables that are not available to regular formulas: value which is the value that a user wants to enter, user which represents a user object that is making the change (you will also see this in the Access rules section). This allows you to make your application even smarter, track when a record was updated , or see who made the last change to a row . Simple examples: Ensure that the value in a column is always written in capital letters: With the trigger formula of value.upper() , the value typed into this column will be converted to upper case automatically. Format a value that the user enters to sanitize the data before saving: With the formula like value if value.startswith(\"SK\") else \"SK\" + value , the value typed into this column will always be prefixed with \u201cSK\u201d. Overwrite a default value from a referenced table: You can use a formula like value or $Client.Phone , to provide a default value from a referenced table, but still allow the user to type a new one. In each of these examples, when the user tries to modify a cell, Grist (before updating the record) will evaluate the formula and store its result in the column instead of the value provided by the user. For a detailed, real-life example read our guide on how to create time and user stamps. For more information on formulas and trigger formulas, check out our webinar Trigger Formulas v.

For example, here\u2019s a formula to find the name of the product with the highest quantity: max(Materials.all, key=lambda m: m.Quantity).Product Formulas are case-sensitive, with Excel-like functions being all-caps ( MAX ), and regular Python generally all lowercase ( max ). For exact matches, there is a shortcut to avoid iteration called lookupRecords , or lookupOne for single matches. Just pass the the values of columns you require to be matched. For example, here is a formula to look up the product name of a material with a quantity of 52: Materials.lookupOne(Quantity=52).Product For very large tables, it is wise to use lookups as much as you can, rather than iterating through rows. Returning to our example document, you can now see how we calculated the Total Spent , Average Quantity , and Most Ordered Product columns: Column Formula Total Spent SUM(Materials.all.Price) Average Quantity AVERAGE(Materials.all.Quantity) Most Ordered Product max(Materials.all, key=lambda m: m.Quantity).Product Separating out calculations like this from the body of your data can take some getting used to, but working this way can help keep your document more organized.

For example, Materials.lookupRecords(Category='Ship') , as here: If you are following on, see Adding a field for details of how to add a new field to a card. If you care about the order of results, lookupRecords takes an optional sort_by parameter. For example, we could use this formula to sort by the product name itself: Materials.lookupRecords(Category='Ship', sort_by='Product').Product If you want to sort by multiple columns, remember that you can create a hidden formula column that combines data in any way you like, and then sort by that.

It may also be useful to store independent data in a column, but still use a formula to calculate it in some situations. This is exactly what Trigger Formulas offer. It is a very powerful feature that allows you to create a Timestamp or Authorship column, recalculate your data based on a set of conditions that you decide , clean data when a new value is entered, or provide sensible default value for a column. To create a Trigger Formula column, you first need to open the creator panel and click on the Set trigger formula action. If you want to convert an existing formula, use the Convert to trigger formula action available in the COLUMN BEHAVIOR section. To control when the formula is evaluated, use the two checkbox options below: Apply to new records triggers the formula only when a new record is created (a default cell value). Apply on record changes triggers the formula when a record is updated. Applying to new records is self-explanatory, the formula will be evaluated only once when you add a new record. It is a perfect solution to provide default values to the empty cells. Second option allows you to fine grain the conditions and specify which columns, when updated, will trigger the evaluation: You probably noticed the first option Current field . At first glance, you probably wonder: \u201cWhy would I want to trigger the column on its own change?\u201d. This option allows you to react to a value that is being entered into the column, just before it is saved! In the formula editor, you have access to two variables that are not available to regular formulas: value which is the value that a user wants to enter, user which represents a user object that is making the change (you will also see this in the Access rules section). This allows you to make your application even smarter, track when a record was updated , or see who made the last change to a row . Simple examples: Ensure that the value in a column is always written in capital letters: With the trigger formula of value.upper() , the value typed into this column will be converted to upper case automatically. Format a value that the user enters to sanitize the data before saving: With the formula like value if value.startswith(\"SK\") else \"SK\" + value , the value typed into this column will always be prefixed with \u201cSK\u201d. Overwrite a default value from a referenced table: You can use a formula like value or $Client.Phone , to provide a default value from a referenced table, but still allow the user to type a new one. In each of these examples, when the user tries to modify a cell, Grist (before updating the record) will evaluate the formula and store its result in the column instead of the value provided by the user.

Using References and Lookups in Formulas # Reference and Reference List columns in Grist allow one table to create an explicit reference to another. A common example of this is seen in the Class Enrollment template. On the Staff page, we have a list of staff members. On the classes page, we have a reference column labeled Instructor that references the records on our Staff page. Keep in mind, it\u2019s not just referencing the Full Name column but the entire record associated with the selected instructor. Reference columns and dot notation # Using a Reference column within a formula can make it easy to get any data from the referenced record. To do this, we use dot notation. It uses the format $A.B where A is the name of the reference column and B is the name of the column in the referenced table that we want to pull data from. Let\u2019s see this in action on the Enrollment View page of the Class Enrollment template. Dot notation is used in the Class_Times column of the ENROLLMENTS table, found at the bottom right of the Enrollment View page. We can see that the Class_Times column is using a formula with dot notation. Using the format $A.B described above, we can figure out that Class is the name of the reference column and Times is the name of the column in the referenced table. Let\u2019s track this back to where it\u2019s pulling from - since the reference column is Class, we can look at that column\u2019s information to find out what table it is pulling from. The Class column references data from the Classes table. Therefore, the Class_Times column is pulling from the Times column of the Classes table. Chaining # If the reference lookup returns a reference, this can be chained. Perhaps we want to add the Instructor\u2019s phone number to the Enrollments table. We can use the Class reference column to pull the instructor\u2019s information from the Classes table. As you can see in the screenshot above, the instructor column is a reference column itself. If we follow the format from before, our dot notation would be $Class.Instructor but the Instructor column points to the entire record of the instructor so we need to tell it what information we want from this record, creating a chain. The instructor column references the Staff table so we navigate there to find out what column we need to pull information from in order to get the phone number. The column that contains the instructor\u2019s phone number is Phone. Putting this all together, our dot notation for the instructor\u2019s phone number would be $Class.Instructor.Phone What happens if we leave our formulas as $Class.Instructor ? You will see a numeric record ID of the record in the Staff table that the Instructor column points to. That\u2019s what a reference column really stores. If you change the type of this formula column to Reference, you will be able to select a column to show, such as the Full Name. Another way to see the name is to chain the dot-notation, as we did for phone: $Class.Instructor.Full_Name . lookupOne # Another way to point to a record is using Table.lookupOne(...) function. lookupOne allows you to look up a record by some fields, similar to Excel\u2019s VLOOKUP. In fact, Grist\u2019s version of VLOOKUP is merely an alias for lookupOne. lookupOne is rarely useful in Grist, because using a Reference type column is usually the preferred solution to connect records. However, on some occasions, lookupOne can be useful. One situation is when you have two sets of data which overlap even though they represent something different and perhaps come from different sources. An example of this can be found in our Event Sponsors + Attendees (References and Lookups) document which is a modified version of the Event Sponsors + Attendees template, available in our template gallery . Let\u2019s say that you run an event and have a list of registered attendees, as well as Sponsors. Registered attendees are stored in the All Registrations table, perhaps populated via a form integration. Sponsors are listed in a separate table, with fields related to their sponsorship, and perhaps maintained by another team. Both tables contain email addresses which identify attendees and sponsors. Sometimes a sponsor may register to attend the event. In that case, you\u2019ll have an Attendee record with an email address that also appears in the Sponsors table. That\u2019s useful to know for someone looking at the attendee list. You can lookup a record in the sponsors table by email address by using a lookupOne formula. The Sponsor column in the All Registrations table does just that using this formula: Sponsors.lookupOne(Contact_Email=$Registration_Email) This formula is looking to see if a Contact Email from the Sponsors table matches a Registration Email from the All Registrations table. The general format for a lookupOne formula is: [Table_Name].lookupOne([A]=$[B]) [Table_Name] is the name of the table you want to lookup data in. [A] is the column in the table being looked up (named at the beginning of the formula) and [B] is the column in the current table / the table you are entering the formula in. Such a formula returns a reference. In the screenshot above, you can see the lookup result returns Sponsors[#] . The number it returns between square brackets is the record ID of the lookup result. Where it returns Sponsors[0] , no match was found. It\u2019s often a good idea to create a column for the lookup result and change its type to Reference, as you see in the screenshot below. Then, if there is a match, the reference column will point to the entire matched record. Like any reference column, you can select which field from that record to show. In this example, it shows the Company field of the matched record in the Sponsors table. lookupOne and dot notation # Because lookupOne is creating a reference to a record, we can use dot notation to look up additional fields in that record. In the example above, Sponsors.lookupOne(Contact_Email=$Registration_Email) is checking if a Contact Email from the Sponsors table matches a Registration Email from the All Registrations table. What if we also wanted to look up the sponsor level? We can add .Sponsor_Level to the lookupOne formula, and, if a match is found, look up the value in the sponsor level column for the matched record. The entire formula would be Sponsors.lookupOne(Contact_Email=$Registration_Email).Sponsor_Level . Now, we have the Sponsor Level listed in the All Registrations table for those attendees whose emails also appear on the sponsor list. lookupOne and sort_by # When the lookupOne function encounters multiple matching results, it returns the first one by row ID. The optional sort_by parameter can be used to sort these results by another field, to determine which one would be returned as the first match. You can also prefix the column ID with \u201c-\u201d to reverse the order. For instance, consider this example from the Class Enrollment template. This template tracks enrollment for extracurricular and other classes - logging information for students, families, and staff. On this page, we have a list of students and their respective information. Additionally, we have a Families page that outlines the parent of each student and we\u2019d like to find which student in each family is the oldest. So, we would create an oldest student column. Then, the following formula would look at the Students table, find the specific students associated with each family, sort them by their birthday, and return the one student with the earliest birthday: Students.lookupOne(Family=$id, sort_by=\"Birthday\") In this case, this would return: Raddon, Brockie. Alternatively, if we want to find the youngest student, the formula would include \u201c-\u201c: Students.lookupOne(Family=$id, sort_by=\"-Birthday\u201d) In this case, this would return: Raddon, Care. Understanding record sets # Sometimes a record may reference multiple records in another table. Multiple references can be made with a Reference List Column. A great example of this is seen on the Habit Tracker template. On the Habits + Goals page, we have a list of habits and a goal for how often we wish to complete that habit. On the Habit Tracker page, we have a Reference List column labeled Habits Completed that references the records on our Habits + Goals page. The only difference between a Reference column and a Reference List column is the ability to select multiple references. This creates a set of records which can be used in formulas. Reference lists and dot notation # Similar to references, you can use Dot Notation with reference lists. Building on our prior example of attendees at a conference, suppose we have a list of registrants for an event and want to find the balance for each registrant. To do this, we can use dot notation. Here, $Registrants is a reference list. Our Great Outdoors Expo has 4 registrants. We can see the list of registrants in the Registrants column. This list is a reference to the Name column of the All Registrants table. With a reference list, dot-notation returns a list of all the selected field; $Registrants.Balance is a list of the Balances for each attendee in the list of $Registrants . This follows the format $[A].[B] where [A] is the name of the Reference List column and [B] is the name of the column in the referenced table you wish to pull data from. We\u2019ll learn how to find the sum of these balances in Working with Record Sets . lookupRecords # You can also get a list of references using lookupRecords . The formula for lookupRecords follows this format: [Table_Name].lookupRecords([A]=$[B]) [Table_Name] is the name of the table you want to lookup data in. [A] is the column in the table being looked up (named at the beginning of the formula) and [B] is the column in the current table / the table you are entering the formula in. Suppose we want a list of the events attended by each person in our Email List table. We can use lookupRecords to do this. First, we need to lookup records where the email listed in the All Registrations table matches an email in this list. Then, find the event associated with each of those records. Following the format above, our initial formula is: All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Registration_Email=$Email) All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Registration_Email=$Email) returns a list of record IDs for each record in the All Registrations table where the Registration Email matches the Email in this row of the Email List table. Next, we need to find the Event associated with each of these records. To do this, we can use dot notation. All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Registration_Email=$Email).Event will return the value from the Event column for each record found. We saw similar results using the lookupOne function. It\u2019s helpful to change the column type to Reference List, as you see in the screenshot below. Then, if there is a match, the reference list column will point to the entire record for each match. Like any reference list column, you can select which field you want to show for the matched records. In this example, it shows the Event field of the Events table for each matched record in the Attendees table. Reverse lookups # LookupRecords works a bit differently if a reference exists between two tables. With a reverse lookup, we can use the record ID to find a record. Every row has a numeric id (available as $id in formulas) that is unique within that table. You can reveal the ID by adding a formula column where formula is $id Let\u2019s take a look at the Registrants column of the Events table. The formula used here is All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Event=$id) . We use the id to find a match because in the All Registrations table, the Event column is a reference column which means its value is a record\u2019s id. Because All_Registrations.Event is a reference column pointing to an Event record in the Events table, we can match the id stored in the reference column to the ids of records in the Events table. That\u2019s why the argument in the formula is Event=$id . We use the existing reference, just in reverse - hence the name, Reverse Lookup. If you\u2019d like a video walkthrough of a reverse lookup, we have an example in our Build with Grist Webinar - Trigger Formulas v. Formulas . Working with record sets # lookupRecords can also be used within other formulas. SUM() can be useful to find a sum of all numbers in a list of records. Once you find your list of records using the lookupRecords function and dot notation, you can use SUM() to sum all values returned, like you see in this formula: SUM(Table.lookupRecords(Column_A=$Column_B).Column_C) You can also do this on a reference list because a reference list is the same thing, a list of records. SUM($RefList.Column) In the Reference lists and dot notation section, we used the Registrants column and dot notation to find the balance for each person in our list of Registrants. We can use SUM() with our prior formula to find the total balance. SUM($Registrants.Balance) We can also use lookupRecords to get the list of references, rather than using a reference list column, then find the sum of the balance for all registrants. This method is used in the Ticket Revenue column of the Events table using the following formula: SUM(All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Event=$id).Balance) All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Event=$id).Balance finds all records in the All Registrations table where the Event column matches the ID of the row in this table, Events. Using dot notation, we find the Balance for each of the records found. Then SUM() sums the balances of all records found. You can also iterate through a Reference List using a Python for loop. An example of this can be seen in the Balance (\u2018for\u2019 loop) column in the Events table. When iterating, each element is a Reference so dot-notation can be used here as well. To find the sum of the balance for all registrants, we use the following formula: SUM(person.Balance for person in $Registrants) This does the same thing as our lookupRecords formula we saw above. $Registrants is our reference list. For each record ( person ) in our list of Registrants, we find the Balance. Then, sum all balances together. In this formula, person is a variable that represents each element in our list and could be replaced with any other variable. If you\u2019d like to learn more about Data Structures and List Comprehension in Python 3, Python.org is a great resource. len() can be useful to get the number of items within a list. Once you find your list of records using the lookupRecords function, you can use len() to count the number of records returned, like you see in this formula: len(Table.lookupRecords(Column_A=$Column_B)) You can also do this on a reference list. len($RefList) We want to see how many events our Sponsors have attended. We can use lookupRecords to do this. The following formula is used in the Events Attended column of the Sponsors table. len(All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Sponsor=$id)) Let\u2019s break down the two parts of this formula, working from the inside out. All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Sponsor=$id) is looking for matches where the record in the Sponsor column of the All Registrations table has the same ID as the record in this row of the Sponsors table. All records in the All Registrations table that match are added to a list of records. Try writing the formula without len() to see what Grist returns. It should look something like this. That\u2019s a list of records. len() counts how many records are in that list. We can also include multiple arguments in a lookupRecords formula. An example of this can be found in the Count column of the Classes table of the Class Enrollment template. This column shows us how many students are enrolled in each class. The formula used here is: len(Enrollments.lookupRecords(Class=$id, Status=\"Confirmed\")) This lookup uses two fields. It will look for records in the Enrollment table where Status is \u201cConfirmed\u201d and the Class column matches the ID of the row in this table. Because the Class column is referencing the Classes table, we use the record ID $id in the lookup. Finally, len() counts the items in the list returned by Enrollments.lookupRecords(Class=$id, Status=\"Confirmed\") . Average, min and max are a few of the other functions that can be used with lookupRecords formulas. See all available functions on our Function reference page.","title":"References and lookups"},{"location":"references-lookups/#using-references-and-lookups-in-formulas","text":"Reference and Reference List columns in Grist allow one table to create an explicit reference to another.

Then, the following formula would look at the Students table, find the specific students associated with each family, sort them by their birthday, and return the one student with the earliest birthday: Students.lookupOne(Family=$id, sort_by=\"Birthday\") In this case, this would return: Raddon, Brockie. Alternatively, if we want to find the youngest student, the formula would include \u201c-\u201c: Students.lookupOne(Family=$id, sort_by=\"-Birthday\u201d) In this case, this would return: Raddon, Care.","title":"lookupOne and sort_by"},{"location":"references-lookups/#understanding-record-sets","text":"Sometimes a record may reference multiple records in another table. Multiple references can be made with a Reference List Column. A great example of this is seen on the Habit Tracker template. On the Habits + Goals page, we have a list of habits and a goal for how often we wish to complete that habit. On the Habit Tracker page, we have a Reference List column labeled Habits Completed that references the records on our Habits + Goals page. The only difference between a Reference column and a Reference List column is the ability to select multiple references. This creates a set of records which can be used in formulas.","title":"Understanding record sets"},{"location":"references-lookups/#reference-lists-and-dot-notation","text":"Similar to references, you can use Dot Notation with reference lists. Building on our prior example of attendees at a conference, suppose we have a list of registrants for an event and want to find the balance for each registrant. To do this, we can use dot notation. Here, $Registrants is a reference list. Our Great Outdoors Expo has 4 registrants. We can see the list of registrants in the Registrants column. This list is a reference to the Name column of the All Registrants table. With a reference list, dot-notation returns a list of all the selected field; $Registrants.Balance is a list of the Balances for each attendee in the list of $Registrants . This follows the format $[A].[B] where [A] is the name of the Reference List column and [B] is the name of the column in the referenced table you wish to pull data from. We\u2019ll learn how to find the sum of these balances in Working with Record Sets .","title":"Reference lists and dot notation"},{"location":"references-lookups/#lookuprecords","text":"You can also get a list of references using lookupRecords . The formula for lookupRecords follows this format: [Table_Name].lookupRecords([A]=$[B]) [Table_Name] is the name of the table you want to lookup data in. [A] is the column in the table being looked up (named at the beginning of the formula) and [B] is the column in the current table / the table you are entering the formula in. Suppose we want a list of the events attended by each person in our Email List table. We can use lookupRecords to do this. First, we need to lookup records where the email listed in the All Registrations table matches an email in this list. Then, find the event associated with each of those records. Following the format above, our initial formula is: All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Registration_Email=$Email) All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Registration_Email=$Email) returns a list of record IDs for each record in the All Registrations table where the Registration Email matches the Email in this row of the Email List table. Next, we need to find the Event associated with each of these records. To do this, we can use dot notation. All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Registration_Email=$Email).Event will return the value from the Event column for each record found. We saw similar results using the lookupOne function. It\u2019s helpful to change the column type to Reference List, as you see in the screenshot below. Then, if there is a match, the reference list column will point to the entire record for each match. Like any reference list column, you can select which field you want to show for the matched records. In this example, it shows the Event field of the Events table for each matched record in the Attendees table.","title":"lookupRecords"},{"location":"references-lookups/#reverse-lookups","text":"LookupRecords works a bit differently if a reference exists between two tables. With a reverse lookup, we can use the record ID to find a record. Every row has a numeric id (available as $id in formulas) that is unique within that table. You can reveal the ID by adding a formula column where formula is $id Let\u2019s take a look at the Registrants column of the Events table. The formula used here is All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Event=$id) . We use the id to find a match because in the All Registrations table, the Event column is a reference column which means its value is a record\u2019s id. Because All_Registrations.Event is a reference column pointing to an Event record in the Events table, we can match the id stored in the reference column to the ids of records in the Events table. That\u2019s why the argument in the formula is Event=$id . We use the existing reference, just in reverse - hence the name, Reverse Lookup. If you\u2019d like a video walkthrough of a reverse lookup, we have an example in our Build with Grist Webinar - Trigger Formulas v. Formulas .","title":"Reverse lookups"},{"location":"references-lookups/#working-with-record-sets","text":"lookupRecords can also be used within other formulas. SUM() can be useful to find a sum of all numbers in a list of records. Once you find your list of records using the lookupRecords function and dot notation, you can use SUM() to sum all values returned, like you see in this formula: SUM(Table.lookupRecords(Column_A=$Column_B).Column_C) You can also do this on a reference list because a reference list is the same thing, a list of records. SUM($RefList.Column) In the Reference lists and dot notation section, we used the Registrants column and dot notation to find the balance for each person in our list of Registrants. We can use SUM() with our prior formula to find the total balance. SUM($Registrants.Balance) We can also use lookupRecords to get the list of references, rather than using a reference list column, then find the sum of the balance for all registrants. This method is used in the Ticket Revenue column of the Events table using the following formula: SUM(All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Event=$id).Balance) All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Event=$id).Balance finds all records in the All Registrations table where the Event column matches the ID of the row in this table, Events. Using dot notation, we find the Balance for each of the records found. Then SUM() sums the balances of all records found. You can also iterate through a Reference List using a Python for loop. An example of this can be seen in the Balance (\u2018for\u2019 loop) column in the Events table. When iterating, each element is a Reference so dot-notation can be used here as well. To find the sum of the balance for all registrants, we use the following formula: SUM(person.Balance for person in $Registrants) This does the same thing as our lookupRecords formula we saw above. $Registrants is our reference list. For each record ( person ) in our list of Registrants, we find the Balance. Then, sum all balances together. In this formula, person is a variable that represents each element in our list and could be replaced with any other variable. If you\u2019d like to learn more about Data Structures and List Comprehension in Python 3, Python.org is a great resource. len() can be useful to get the number of items within a list. Once you find your list of records using the lookupRecords function, you can use len() to count the number of records returned, like you see in this formula: len(Table.lookupRecords(Column_A=$Column_B)) You can also do this on a reference list. len($RefList) We want to see how many events our Sponsors have attended. We can use lookupRecords to do this. The following formula is used in the Events Attended column of the Sponsors table. len(All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Sponsor=$id)) Let\u2019s break down the two parts of this formula, working from the inside out. All_Registrations.lookupRecords(Sponsor=$id) is looking for matches where the record in the Sponsor column of the All Registrations table has the same ID as the record in this row of the Sponsors table. All records in the All Registrations table that match are added to a list of records. Try writing the formula without len() to see what Grist returns. It should look something like this. That\u2019s a list of records. len() counts how many records are in that list. We can also include multiple arguments in a lookupRecords formula. An example of this can be found in the Count column of the Classes table of the Class Enrollment template. This column shows us how many students are enrolled in each class. The formula used here is: len(Enrollments.lookupRecords(Class=$id, Status=\"Confirmed\")) This lookup uses two fields. It will look for records in the Enrollment table where Status is \u201cConfirmed\u201d and the Class column matches the ID of the row in this table. Because the Class column is referencing the Classes table, we use the record ID $id in the lookup. Finally, len() counts the items in the list returned by Enrollments.lookupRecords(Class=$id, Status=\"Confirmed\") . Average, min and max are a few of the other functions that can be used with lookupRecords formulas. See all available functions on our Function reference page.","title":"Working with record sets"},{"location":"dates/","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

The first is the Date column type, which represents a calendar date, with no time of day, and not associated with any particular timezone. The second is the DateTime column type, which represents a calendar date with a time of day which can be linked with a timezone. The Date and DateTime column types support different formatting options. When a column is set to be a Date or a DateTime , a date-picker widget will let you select the date on a calendar when editing a cell. When working with dates in formulas, the dates are Python datetime objects . That allows you to do some powerful things, but can be unexpected if you\u2019re not familiar with them. Making a date/time column # For a general introduction to setting the type of columns, see Columns and data types . To tell Grist that you intend to enter only date/times in a column, over on the header for the column, find the drop-down, and select \u201cColumn Options\u201d. Then in the side panel that opens on the right, pick \u201cDate\u201d from the \u201cColumn Type\u201d drop-down. Or, if you want dates with times, pick \u201cDateTime\u201d. Then you can choose your preferred date/time format. For the \u201cDateTime\u201d type, you can also choose the timezone. When you convert a column from another type, such as \u201cText\u201d, you\u2019ll see a preview of the conversion results, and will need to click \u201cApply\u201d to complete conversion. You can come back and change settings at any time. Now when you edit a cell in this column, you will have help for selecting dates and times. Inserting the current date # You can insert the current date in a cell using \u2318 + ; (semicolon) (Mac) or Ctrl + ; (Windows). You can insert the current date and time using \u2318 + Shift + ; (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + ; (Windows). When editing a date cell, the date entry widget has a \u201ctoday\u201d button for today\u2019s date. Parsing dates from strings # The DATEVALUE function converts a string that represents a date into a datetime object. It\u2019s simple to use and it will auto-detect different date formats: You can also use Python\u2019s datetime library, which provides two helpful functions: strptime() and strftime() . For example, let\u2019s say you have a table of movie sequels and their release dates (as strings). You\u2019d like to parse out the actual date to be able to sort the table properly. Here\u2019s how you would do that: First line imports the datetime library The second line splits the string into two parts and returns the second part (Python arrays are zero-based). The third line uses Python\u2019s strptime function to parse the date (e.g. \u201cMay 19, 1999\u201d) into a datetime object. The first parameter to the function is the string to parse, the second parameter is the date format that the string is in. Take a look at the format options to see if the example format string %B %d, %Y makes sense. (Note: You could\u2019ve also used DATEVALUE(d) to achieve the same result.) The result has a true date column and can now be properly sorted chronologically, with \u201cA New Hope\u201d at the top. For historical reasons, the first Star Wars movie is considered to be Episode 4. And, because the column type is selected as a date, you can use the \u201cDate Format\u201d in \u201cColumn Options\u201d to select the format in which to display the date. For some situations, you may wish to use the dateutil python library. For example, if you live in an area where dates typically start with the day and then the month, you could use this formula: import dateutil dateutil.parser.parse($date_text, dayfirst=True) Date arithmetic # Once you have a proper date column, often you\u2019ll want to do date arithmetic such as calculating the difference between two dates. The simplest way to do this is to use the DATEDIF function which takes two dates and the unit of information to return (Days, Months, or Years). You could also use the minus sign to subtract two dates, but you might be surprised at the result: This happens because subtracting two datetime objects as we did in the example above, results in a datetime.timedelta object which represents, \u201cA duration expressing the difference between two date, time, or datetime instances to microsecond resolution.\u201d In Grist (and Python) you have to be more specific above how you want to display the date difference. For example, to get the number of days from the returned timedelta object, use its .days property: If you want weeks or years, just divide by 7 or by 365. (Divide by 7.0 or 365.0 to include a fractional part in the result.) If you want hours, multiply by 24. You can also use specific functions to get what you want. For example, DAYS is a common function in spreadsheet apps that returns the difference between two dates: DAYS($Last_day, $First_day) Excel/Sheets formulas Grist supports many other common functions from other spreadsheet apps, including DATEADD , DATEDIF , DATEVALUE , MONTH , HOUR , and many more . Getting a part of the date # You\u2019ve seen how to parse the date, display it in different formats, and do date arithmetic. But what if you want to get more information about a specific date, such as getting its day of the week? One option is to use the WEEKDAY function, which behaves as it does in Excel, returning 1-7 for Sunday-Saturday. Alternatively, we can use the strftime function: Yet another option would be to reformat the date using Date Format in Column Options (see the date formatting reference ). Time zones # Values in DateTime columns represent moments in time. The same moment will look different in different timezones. In Grist, the timezone is set on each DateTime column. For instance, if the timezone is set to \u201cAmerica/New_York\u201d, it will show the values in New York timezone to collaborators anywhere in the world. A Grist document has a global timezone setting, which serves as the default timezone for when you create a new column of type DateTime . This global timezone is set to your local timezone when you first create a document. You can see or change it by clicking on your profile picture or icon, and selecting \u201cDocument Settings\u201d. If you insert the current date and time using \u2318 + Shift + ; (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + ; (Windows) into a DateTime column, it will be inserted as a true timezone-aware timestamp, and shown with the timezone set for that column. If you do the same in a Text column, the date/time will be inserted as the text appropriate for the document\u2019s global timezone setting. Similarly, inserting the current date into a Date column will produce the current date according to the document\u2019s timezone.

Python # Grist formulas are written in Python, the most popular language for data science. The entirety of Python\u2019s standard library is available to you. For those with a spreadsheet background, we\u2019ve also added a suite of Excel-like functions, with all-uppercase names. Here\u2019s the full list of functions . Python formulas are evaluated in a sandbox, without internet access, and without a persistent filesystem. Supported Python versions # We currently support two versions of Python: Python 3 (specifically 3.11 at the time of writing) Python 2 (specifically 2.7) Newly created documents on our hosted service use Python 3 by default, while older documents (created before November 2021 approximately) use Python 2 by default. To tell which version of Python a specific document uses, look at its Document Settings . The Engine setting may be python2 , python3 , or blank. A blank setting implies python2 . If you have editing rights on a document, you can change the Engine setting, and the document will then reload with all formulas now interpreted using the version of Python you have specified. We recommend caution in doing so. A formula that works as intended in one version of Python may give errors in another, or (worse) give the wrong results. Warning Some formulas may fail or give wrong results if used with a version of Python that is different from the one for which they were written. Python 2 reached its end of life in January 2020, so if you look online for python help, the answers you find are more and more likely to be for Python 3. If you have a document that uses Python 2, and you\u2019d like to switch it to use Python 3, we recommend reading Testing the effect of changing Python versions and Differences between Python versions . Be sure to check all tables and columns, and both regular formalas and trigger formulas. We\u2019d be interested to hear your experience, and to help with any problems, on the community forum . Self-hosted Grist may use any version of Python you configure it with, but bear in mind we actively test only the supported versions. Testing the effect of changing Python versions # Grist has some features that can help you evaluate the consequences of changing the Python version a document uses. The Work on a Copy feature is useful to experiment with changing the Python version without affecting your document until you are ready. There is a \u201cCompare with original\u201d option that will let you visualize which cells changed, if any. Be sure to look at all tables and columns. The Activity tab of Document History (with \u201cAll Tables\u201d selected) lets you review in more detail what has changed. Be careful to test any trigger formulas you may have, since the Python code in them won\u2019t be exercised until you specifically trigger these formulas. You can use the code viewer to quickly remind yourself of all formulas in a document, so you can systematically check them all. Differences between Python versions # There are important differences between Python 2 and 3. Formulas may need to be changed in order to give the same results when switching between Python versions. There are many online resources such as this compatibility cheatsheet which can help figure out what the issue is when you hit a difference, and get ideas on how to resolve it. Here, we list common cases we\u2019ve seen in Grist formulas. Division of whole numbers # In Python 2, dividing whole numbers gives a whole number, so 9 / 2 is 4 . In Python 3, it is 4.5 . For a spreadsheet, this is a much more sensible answer, but if you rely on the Python 2 behavior, we suggest you switch to the // operator which is consistent between versions ( 9 // 2 is 4 for both). For example the General Ledger template had a Python 2 formula for computing the quarter from a date (so a Date of 2021-08-15 gave a Quarter of 2021 Q3 ) as follows: \"%s Q%s\" % ($Date.year, CEILING($Date.month, 3) / 3) when switching to Python 3, this needed correcting to: \"%s Q%s\" % ($Date.year, CEILING($Date.month, 3) // 3) Otherwise Quarters became fractional! Some imports are reorganized # Python has a useful standard library, but some parts of it were moved around between Python 2 and 3. For example, several of our templates have formulas to construct URLs, to open custom searches for example, or to open a pre-populated email with calculated To , CC , and Subject values. Python has handy helpers for constructing URLs, but they moved around a bit between Python versions. Our Lightweight CRM example had a Python 2 formula like this to kick off a search for emails in Gmail: from urllib import quote_plus \"Gmail search https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/%s\" % quote_plus($Email) In Python 3, the import line needed changing to: from urllib.parse import quote_plus Subtle change in rounding # Python 3 switches the built-in function round() from rounding the way many people learned in school (where when rounding .5 , you always round up) to what is called \u201cbanker\u2019s rounding\u201d (where you round from .5 to the nearest even number). This is generally accepted as an improvement, mitigating a bias to larger numbers that can become significant at scale. But it could be a surprise to see numbers change like this in an established document. If you really need Python 2\u2019s rounding, replace any calls to Python\u2019s round function with the Excel-compatible ROUND function. For example: round($val, 2) would be replaced with: ROUND($val, 2) Unicode text handling # Python 2 does not shine at handling international text and emojis. We have mitigated many problems by setting the default encoding to utf8 for all documents. Nevertheless, when switching from Python 2 to Python 3, you may see type changes or errors. Consider this Python 2 formula to generate a one-way hash of an email address: import hashlib hashlib.sha256($Email).hexdigest() In Python 3 this fails with TypeError: Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing , which can be resolved by replacing $Email with $Email.encode() : import hashlib hashlib.sha256($Email.encode()).hexdigest()","title":"Python versions"},{"location":"python/#python","text":"Grist formulas are written in Python, the most popular language for data science.

Grist formulas support most Excel functions, as well as the Python programming language. The table below lists Grist-specific functions, and the suite of the included Excel-like functions. In addition, the entire Python standard library is available. For more about using formulas in Grist, see Intro to Formulas . Grist uses Python (version 3.11) for formulas. You can use nearly all features of Python (see Python documentation ). Here are some helpful notes: Python is case-sensitive, including for Grist table and column names. Excel-like functions are always in uppercase. E.g. if is a Python keyword, while IF is an Excel-like function. Compare for equality using == , in place of Excel\u2019s single = (which in Python means assignment). \u201cNot equal\u201d uses != in place of Excel\u2019s <> . You may write multi-line Python in formulas (use Shift + Enter to add lines), including statements, variables, imports, etc. Grist code runs in a secure sandbox, with no access to anything outside your document.

It is the primary means of accessing values in formulas. A Record for a particular table has a property for each data and formula column in the table. In a formula, $field is translated to rec.field , where rec is the Record for which the formula is being evaluated. For example: def Full_Name(rec, table): return rec.First_Name + ' ' + rec.LastName def Name_Length(rec, table): return len(rec.Full_Name) $Field # $ Field or rec .Field # Access the field named \u201cField\u201d of the current record. E.g. $First_Name or rec.First_Name . $group # $group # In a summary table , $group is a special field containing the list of Records that are summarized by the current summary line. E.g. the formula len($group) counts the number of those records being summarized in each row. See RecordSet for useful properties offered by the returned object. Examples: sum($group.Amount) # Sum of the Amount field in the matching records sum(r.Amount for r in $group) # Same as sum($group.Amount) sum(r.Amount for r in $group if r > 0) # Sum of only the positive amounts sum(r.Shares * r.Price for r in $group) # Sum of shares * price products RecordSet # class RecordSet # A RecordSet represents a collection of records, as returned by Table.lookupRecords() or $group property in summary views. A RecordSet allows iterating through the records: sum(r.Amount for r in Students.lookupRecords(First_Name=\"John\", Last_Name=\"Doe\")) min(r.DueDate for r in Tasks.lookupRecords(Owner=\"Bob\")) RecordSets also provide a convenient way to access the list of values for a particular field for all the records, as record_set.Field . For example, the examples above are equivalent to: sum(Students.lookupRecords(First_Name=\"John\", Last_Name=\"Doe\").Amount) min(Tasks.lookupRecords(Owner=\"Bob\").DueDate) You can get the number of records in a RecordSet using len , e.g. len($group) . UserTable # class UserTable # Each data table in the document is represented in the code by an instance of UserTable class. These names are always capitalized. A UserTable provides access to all the records in the table, as well as methods to look up particular records. Every table in the document is available to all formulas. all # UserTable. all # The list of all the records in this table. For example, this evaluates to the number of records in the table Students . len(Students.all) This evaluates to the sum of the Population field for every record in the table Countries . sum(r.Population for r in Countries.all) lookupOne # UserTable. lookupOne (Field_In_Lookup_Table=value, \u2026) # Returns a Record matching the given field=value arguments. The value may be any expression, most commonly a field in the current row (e.g. $SomeField ) or a constant (e.g. a quoted string like \"Some Value\" ). If multiple records are found, the first match is returned. You may set the optional sort_by parameter to the column ID by which to sort multiple matching results, to determine which of them is returned. You can prefix the column ID with \u201c-\u201d to reverse the order. For example: People.lookupOne(First_Name=\"Lewis\", Last_Name=\"Carroll\") People.lookupOne(Email=$Work_Email) Tickets.lookupOne(Person=$id, sort_by=\"Date\") # Find the first ticket for the person Tickets.lookupOne(Person=$id, sort_by=\"-Date\") # Find the last ticket for the person Learn more about lookupOne . lookupRecords # UserTable. lookupRecords (Field_In_Lookup_Table=value, \u2026) # Returns a RecordSet matching the given field=value arguments. The value may be any expression, most commonly a field in the current row (e.g. $SomeField ) or a constant (e.g. a quoted string like \"Some Value\" ) (examples below). You may set the optional sort_by parameter to the column ID by which to sort multiple matching results, to determine which of them is returned. You can prefix the column ID with \u201c-\u201d to reverse the order. For example: People.lookupRecords(Email=$Work_Email) People.lookupRecords(First_Name=\"George\", Last_Name=\"Washington\") People.lookupRecords(Last_Name=\"Johnson\", sort_by=\"First_Name\") Orders.lookupRecords(Customer=$id, sort_by=\"-OrderDate\") See RecordSet for useful properties offered by the returned object. See CONTAINS for an example utilizing UserTable.lookupRecords to find records where a field of a list type (such as Choice List or Reference List ) contains the given value. Learn more about lookupRecords . Date # DATE # DATE (year, month, day) # Returns the datetime.datetime object that represents a particular date. The DATE function is most useful in formulas where year, month, and day are formulas, not constants. If year is between 0 and 1899 (inclusive), adds 1900 to calculate the year. >>> DATE(108, 1, 2) datetime.date(2008, 1, 2) >>> DATE(2008, 1, 2) datetime.date(2008, 1, 2) If month is greater than 12, rolls into the following year. >>> DATE(2008, 14, 2) datetime.date(2009, 2, 2) If month is less than 1, subtracts that many months plus 1, from the first month in the year. >>> DATE(2008, -3, 2) datetime.date(2007, 9, 2) If day is greater than the number of days in the given month, rolls into the following months. >>> DATE(2008, 1, 35) datetime.date(2008, 2, 4) If day is less than 1, subtracts that many days plus 1, from the first day of the given month. >>> DATE(2008, 1, -15) datetime.date(2007, 12, 16) DATEADD # DATEADD (start_date, days=0, months=0, years=0, weeks=0) # Returns the date a given number of days, months, years, or weeks away from start_date . You may specify arguments in any order if you specify argument names. Use negative values to subtract. For example, DATEADD(date, 1) is the same as DATEADD(date, days=1) , ands adds one day to date . DATEADD(date, years=1, days=-1) adds one year minus one day. >>> DATEADD(DATE(2011, 1, 15), 1) datetime.date(2011, 1, 16) >>> DATEADD(DATE(2011, 1, 15), months=1, days=-1) datetime.date(2011, 2, 14) >>> DATEADD(DATE(2011, 1, 15), years=-2, months=1, days=3, weeks=2) datetime.date(2009, 3, 4) >>> DATEADD(DATE(1975, 4, 30), years=50, weeks=-5) datetime.date(2025, 3, 26) DATEDIF # DATEDIF (start_date, end_date, unit) # Calculates the number of days, months, or years between two dates.

See http://www.dwheeler.com/yearfrac/ for analysis of Excel\u2019s particular implementation. Basis -1 is similar to 1 , but differs from Excel when dates span both leap and non-leap years.

ISEMAIL # ISEMAIL (value) # Returns whether a value is a valid email address. Note that checking email validity is not an exact science. The technical standard considers many email addresses valid that are not used in practice, and would not be considered valid by most users. Instead, we follow Google Sheets implementation, with some differences, noted below. >>> ISEMAIL(\"Abc.123@example.com\") True >>> ISEMAIL(\"Bob_O-Reilly+tag@example.com\") True >>> ISEMAIL(\"John Doe\") False >>> ISEMAIL(\"john@aol...com\") False ISERR # ISERR (value) # Checks whether a value is an error. In other words, it returns true if using value directly would raise an exception. NOTE: Grist implements this by automatically wrapping the argument to use lazy evaluation. A more Pythonic approach to checking for errors is: try: ... value ... except Exception, err: ... do something about the error ... For example: >>> ISERR(\"Hello\") False ISERROR # ISERROR (value) # Checks whether a value is an error or an invalid value. It is similar to ISERR , but also returns true for an invalid value such as NaN or a text value in a Numeric column. NOTE: Grist implements this by automatically wrapping the argument to use lazy evaluation. >>> ISERROR(\"Hello\") False >>> ISERROR(AltText(\"fail\")) True >>> ISERROR(float('nan')) True ISLOGICAL # ISLOGICAL (value) # Checks whether a value is True or False . >>> ISLOGICAL(True) True >>> ISLOGICAL(False) True >>> ISLOGICAL(0) False >>> ISLOGICAL(None) False >>> ISLOGICAL(\"Test\") False ISNA # ISNA (value) # Checks whether a value is the error #N/A . >>> ISNA(float('nan')) True >>> ISNA(0.0) False >>> ISNA('text') False >>> ISNA(float('-inf')) False ISNONTEXT # ISNONTEXT (value) # Checks whether a value is non-textual. >>> ISNONTEXT(\"asdf\") False >>> ISNONTEXT(\"\") False >>> ISNONTEXT(AltText(\"text\")) False >>> ISNONTEXT(17.0) True >>> ISNONTEXT(None) True >>> ISNONTEXT(datetime.date(2011, 1, 1)) True ISNUMBER # ISNUMBER (value) # Checks whether a value is a number. >>> ISNUMBER(17) True >>> ISNUMBER(-123.123423) True >>> ISNUMBER(False) True >>> ISNUMBER(float('nan')) True >>> ISNUMBER(float('inf')) True >>> ISNUMBER('17') False >>> ISNUMBER(None) False >>> ISNUMBER(datetime.date(2011, 1, 1)) False ISREF # ISREF (value) # Checks whether a value is a table record. For example, if a column person is of type Reference to the People table, then ISREF($person) is True . Similarly, ISREF(People.lookupOne(name=$name)) is True . For any other type of value, ISREF() would evaluate to False . >>> ISREF(17) False >>> ISREF(\"Roger\") False ISREFLIST # ISREFLIST (value) # Checks whether a value is a RecordSet , the type of values in Reference List columns. For example, if a column people is of type Reference List to the People table, then ISREFLIST($people) is True . Similarly, ISREFLIST(People.lookupRecords(name=$name)) is True . For any other type of value, ISREFLIST() would evaluate to False . >>> ISREFLIST(17) False >>> ISREFLIST(\"Roger\") False ISTEXT # ISTEXT (value) # Checks whether a value is text. >>> ISTEXT(\"asdf\") True >>> ISTEXT(\"\") True >>> ISTEXT(AltText(\"text\")) True >>> ISTEXT(17.0) False >>> ISTEXT(None) False >>> ISTEXT(datetime.date(2011, 1, 1)) False ISURL # ISURL (value) # Checks whether a value is a valid URL. It does not need to be fully qualified, or to include \u201chttp://\u201d and \u201cwww\u201d. It does not follow a standard, but attempts to work similarly to ISURL in Google Sheets, and to return True for text that is likely a URL. Valid protocols include ftp, http, https, gopher, mailto, news, telnet, and aim. >>> ISURL(\"http://www.getgrist.com\") True >>> ISURL(\"https://foo.com/test_(wikipedia)#cite-1\") True >>> ISURL(\"mailto://user@example.com\") True >>> ISURL(\"http:///a\") False N # N (value) # Returns the value converted to a number. True/False are converted to 1/0. A date is converted to Excel-style serial number of the date. Anything else is converted to 0. >>> N(7) 7 >>> N(7.1) 7.1 >>> N(\"Even\") 0 >>> N(\"7\") 0 >>> N(True) 1 >>> N(datetime.datetime(2011, 4, 17)) 40650.0 NA # NA () # Returns the \u201cvalue not available\u201d error, #N/A . >>> math.isnan(NA()) True PEEK # PEEK (func) # Evaluates the given expression without creating dependencies or requiring that referenced values are up to date, using whatever value it finds in a cell. This is useful for preventing circular reference errors, particularly in trigger formulas. For example, if the formula for A depends on $B and the formula for B depends on $A , then normally this would raise a circular reference error because each value needs to be calculated before the other. But if A uses PEEK($B) then it will simply get the value already stored in $B without requiring that $B is first calculated to the latest value. Therefore A will be calculated first, and B can use $A without problems. RECORD # RECORD (record_or_list, dates_as_iso=False, expand_refs=0) # Returns a Python dictionary with all fields in the given record. If a list of records is given, returns a list of corresponding Python dictionaries. If dates_as_iso is set, Date and DateTime values are converted to string using ISO 8601 format. If expand_refs is set to 1 or higher, Reference values are replaced with a RECORD representation of the referenced record, expanding the given number of levels. Error values present in cells of the record are replaced with None value, and a special key of \u201c error \u201d gets added containing the error messages for those cells. For example: {\"Ratio\": None, \"_error_\": {\"Ratio\": \"ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero\"}} Note that care is needed to avoid circular references when using RECORD(), since it creates a dependency on every cell in the record. In case of RECORD(rec), the cell containing this call will be omitted from the resulting dictionary. For example: RECORD($Person) RECORD(rec) RECORD(People.lookupOne(First_Name=\"Alice\")) RECORD(People.lookupRecords(Department=\"HR\")) REQUEST # REQUEST (url, params=None, headers=None, method=\u2019GET\u2019, data=None, json=None) # Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist.

This function is provided primarily for compatibility with other spreadsheet programs. >>> FALSE() False IF # IF (logical_expression, value_if_true, value_if_false) # Returns one value if a logical expression is True and another if it is False . The equivalent Python expression is: value_if_true if logical_expression else value_if_false Since Grist supports multi-line formulas, you may also use Python blocks such as: if logical_expression: return value_if_true else: return value_if_false NOTE: Grist follows Excel model by only evaluating one of the value expressions, by automatically wrapping the expressions to use lazy evaluation. This allows IF(False, 1/0, 1) to evaluate to 1 rather than raise an exception. >>> IF(12, \"Yes\", \"No\") 'Yes' >>> IF(None, \"Yes\", \"No\") 'No' >>> IF(True, 0.85, 0.0) 0.85 >>> IF(False, 0.85, 0.0) 0.0 IFERROR # IFERROR (value, value_if_error=\u2019\u2018) # Returns the first argument if it is not an error value, otherwise returns the second argument if present, or a blank if the second argument is absent.

The value may be any expression, most commonly a field in the current row (e.g. $SomeField ) or a constant (e.g. a quoted string like \"Some Value\" ). If multiple records are found, the first match is returned. You may set the optional sort_by parameter to the column ID by which to sort multiple matching results, to determine which of them is returned. You can prefix the column ID with \u201c-\u201d to reverse the order. For example: People.lookupOne(First_Name=\"Lewis\", Last_Name=\"Carroll\") People.lookupOne(Email=$Work_Email) Tickets.lookupOne(Person=$id, sort_by=\"Date\") # Find the first ticket for the person Tickets.lookupOne(Person=$id, sort_by=\"-Date\") # Find the last ticket for the person Learn more about lookupOne . lookupRecords # UserTable. lookupRecords (Field_In_Lookup_Table=value, \u2026) # Returns a RecordSet matching the given field=value arguments. The value may be any expression, most commonly a field in the current row (e.g. $SomeField ) or a constant (e.g. a quoted string like \"Some Value\" ) (examples below). You may set the optional sort_by parameter to the column ID by which to sort multiple matching results, to determine which of them is returned. You can prefix the column ID with \u201c-\u201d to reverse the order. For example: People.lookupRecords(Email=$Work_Email) People.lookupRecords(First_Name=\"George\", Last_Name=\"Washington\") People.lookupRecords(Last_Name=\"Johnson\", sort_by=\"First_Name\") Orders.lookupRecords(Customer=$id, sort_by=\"-OrderDate\") See RecordSet for useful properties offered by the returned object. See CONTAINS for an example utilizing UserTable.lookupRecords to find records where a field of a list type (such as Choice List or Reference List ) contains the given value. Learn more about lookupRecords . ADDRESS # ADDRESS (row, column, absolute_relative_mode, use_a1_notation, sheet) # Returns a cell reference as a string.

Note This function is not currently implemented in Grist. CONTAINS # CONTAINS (value, match_empty=no_match_empty) # Use this marker with UserTable.lookupRecords to find records where a field of a list type (such as Choice List or Reference List ) contains the given value. For example: MoviesTable.lookupRecords(genre=CONTAINS(\"Drama\")) will return records in MoviesTable where the column genre is a list or other container such as [\"Comedy\", \"Drama\"] , i.e. \"Drama\" in $genre . Note that the column being looked up (e.g. genre ) must have values of a container type such as list, tuple, or set. In particular the values mustn\u2019t be strings, e.g. \"Comedy-Drama\" won\u2019t match even though \"Drama\" in \"Comedy-Drama\" is True in Python. It also won\u2019t match substrings within container elements, e.g. [\"Comedy-Drama\"] . You can optionally pass a second argument match_empty to indicate a value that should be matched against empty lists in the looked up column. For example, given this formula: MoviesTable.lookupRecords(genre=CONTAINS(g, match_empty='')) If g is '' (i.e. equal to match_empty ) then the column genre in the returned records will either be an empty list (or other container) or a list containing g as usual. GETPIVOTDATA # GETPIVOTDATA (value_name, any_pivot_table_cell, original_column_1, pivot_item_1=None, *args) # Extracts an aggregated value from a pivot table that corresponds to the specified row and column headings.

Since UUID() produces a different value each time it\u2019s called, it is best to use it in trigger formula for new records. This would only calculate UUID() once and freeze the calculated value.

Schedule # SCHEDULE # SCHEDULE (schedule, start=None, count=10, end=None) # Returns the list of datetime objects generated according to the schedule string. Starts at start , which defaults to NOW(). Generates at most count results (10 by default). If end is given, stops there. The schedule has the format \u201cINTERVAL: SLOTS, \u2026\u201d. For example: annual: Jan-15, Apr-15, Jul-15 -- Three times a year on given dates at midnight. annual: 1/15, 4/15, 7/15 -- Same as above. monthly: /1 2pm, /15 2pm -- The 1st and the 15th of each month, at 2pm. 3-months: /10, +1m /20 -- Every 3 months on the 10th of month 1, 20th of month 2. weekly: Mo 9am, Tu 9am, Fr 2pm -- Three times a week at specified times. 2-weeks: Mo, +1w Tu -- Every 2 weeks on Monday of week 1, Tuesday of week 2. daily: 07:30, 21:00 -- Twice a day at specified times. 2-day: 12am, 4pm, +1d 8am -- Three times every two days, evenly spaced. hourly: :15, :45 -- 15 minutes before and after each hour. 4-hour: :00, 1:20, 2:40 -- Three times every 4 hours, evenly spaced. 10-minute: +0s -- Every 10 minutes on the minute. INTERVAL must be either of the form N-unit where N is a number and unit is one of year , month , week , day , hour ; or one of the aliases: annual , monthly , weekly , daily , hourly , which mean 1-year , 1-month , etc. SLOTS support the following units: `Jan-15` or `1/15` -- Month and day of the month; available when INTERVAL is year-based. `/15` -- Day of the month, available when INTERVAL is month-based. `Mon`, `Mo`, `Friday` -- Day of the week (or abbreviation), when INTERVAL is week-based. 10am, 1:30pm, 15:45 -- Time of day, available for day-based or longer intervals. :45, :00 -- Minutes of the hour, available when INTERVAL is hour-based. +1d, +15d -- How many days to add to start of INTERVAL. +1w -- How many weeks to add to start of INTERVAL. +1m -- How many months to add to start of INTERVAL. The SLOTS are always relative to the INTERVAL rather than to start . Week-based intervals start on Sunday. E.g. weekly: +1d, +4d is the same as weekly: Mon, Thu , and generates times on Mondays and Thursdays regardless of start . The first generated time is determined by the unit of the INTERVAL without regard to the multiple. E.g. both \u201c2-week: Mon\u201d and \u201c3-week: Mon\u201d start on the first Monday after start , and then generate either every second or every third Monday after that. Similarly, 24-hour: :00 starts with the first top-of-the-hour after start (not with midnight), and then repeats every 24 hours. To start with the midnight after start , use daily: 0:00 . For interval units of a day or longer, if time-of-day is not specified, it defaults to midnight. The time zone of start determines the time zone of the generated times. >>> def show(dates): return [d.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\") for d in dates] >>> start = datetime(2018, 9, 4, 14, 0); # 2pm on Tue, Sep 4 2018. >>> show(SCHEDULE('annual: Jan-15, Apr-15, Jul-15, Oct-15', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-10-15 00:00', '2019-01-15 00:00', '2019-04-15 00:00', '2019-07-15 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('annual: 1/15, 4/15, 7/15', start=start, count=4)) ['2019-01-15 00:00', '2019-04-15 00:00', '2019-07-15 00:00', '2020-01-15 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('monthly: /1 2pm, /15 5pm', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-15 17:00', '2018-10-01 14:00', '2018-10-15 17:00', '2018-11-01 14:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('3-months: /10, +1m /20', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-10 00:00', '2018-10-20 00:00', '2018-12-10 00:00', '2019-01-20 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('weekly: Mo 9am, Tu 9am, Fr 2pm', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-07 14:00', '2018-09-10 09:00', '2018-09-11 09:00', '2018-09-14 14:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('2-weeks: Mo, +1w Tu', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-11 00:00', '2018-09-17 00:00', '2018-09-25 00:00', '2018-10-01 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('daily: 07:30, 21:00', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 21:00', '2018-09-05 07:30', '2018-09-05 21:00', '2018-09-06 07:30'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('2-day: 12am, 4pm, +1d 8am', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 16:00', '2018-09-05 08:00', '2018-09-06 00:00', '2018-09-06 16:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('hourly: :15, :45', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 14:15', '2018-09-04 14:45', '2018-09-04 15:15', '2018-09-04 15:45'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('4-hour: :00, +1H :20, +2H :40', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 14:00', '2018-09-04 15:20', '2018-09-04 16:40', '2018-09-04 18:00'] Stats # AVEDEV # AVEDEV (value1, value2) # Calculates the average of the magnitudes of deviations of data from a dataset\u2019s mean.

If country is omitted, or the number does not correspond to the given country, the international format is used instead. \"+\" or \"INTL\" - international format, e.g. +1 234-567-8901 or +33 2 34 56 78 90 . \"*\" or \"E164\" - E164 format, like international but with no separators, e.g. +12345678901 . \"tel\" or \"RFC3966\" - format suitable to use as a hyperlink , e.g. \u2018tel:+1-234-567-8901\u2019. When specifying the format argument, you may omit the country argument. I.e. PHONE_FORMAT(value, \"tel\") is equivalent to PHONE_FORMAT(value, None, \"tel\") .

Grist formulas support most Excel functions, as well as the Python programming language. The table below lists Grist-specific functions, and the suite of the included Excel-like functions. In addition, the entire Python standard library is available. For more about using formulas in Grist, see Intro to Formulas . Grist uses Python (version 3.11) for formulas. You can use nearly all features of Python (see Python documentation ). Here are some helpful notes: Python is case-sensitive, including for Grist table and column names. Excel-like functions are always in uppercase. E.g. if is a Python keyword, while IF is an Excel-like function. Compare for equality using == , in place of Excel\u2019s single = (which in Python means assignment). \u201cNot equal\u201d uses != in place of Excel\u2019s <> . You may write multi-line Python in formulas (use Shift + Enter to add lines), including statements, variables, imports, etc. Grist code runs in a secure sandbox, with no access to anything outside your document.

For example: annual: Jan-15, Apr-15, Jul-15 -- Three times a year on given dates at midnight. annual: 1/15, 4/15, 7/15 -- Same as above. monthly: /1 2pm, /15 2pm -- The 1st and the 15th of each month, at 2pm. 3-months: /10, +1m /20 -- Every 3 months on the 10th of month 1, 20th of month 2. weekly: Mo 9am, Tu 9am, Fr 2pm -- Three times a week at specified times. 2-weeks: Mo, +1w Tu -- Every 2 weeks on Monday of week 1, Tuesday of week 2. daily: 07:30, 21:00 -- Twice a day at specified times. 2-day: 12am, 4pm, +1d 8am -- Three times every two days, evenly spaced. hourly: :15, :45 -- 15 minutes before and after each hour. 4-hour: :00, 1:20, 2:40 -- Three times every 4 hours, evenly spaced. 10-minute: +0s -- Every 10 minutes on the minute. INTERVAL must be either of the form N-unit where N is a number and unit is one of year , month , week , day , hour ; or one of the aliases: annual , monthly , weekly , daily , hourly , which mean 1-year , 1-month , etc. SLOTS support the following units: `Jan-15` or `1/15` -- Month and day of the month; available when INTERVAL is year-based. `/15` -- Day of the month, available when INTERVAL is month-based. `Mon`, `Mo`, `Friday` -- Day of the week (or abbreviation), when INTERVAL is week-based. 10am, 1:30pm, 15:45 -- Time of day, available for day-based or longer intervals. :45, :00 -- Minutes of the hour, available when INTERVAL is hour-based. +1d, +15d -- How many days to add to start of INTERVAL. +1w -- How many weeks to add to start of INTERVAL. +1m -- How many months to add to start of INTERVAL. The SLOTS are always relative to the INTERVAL rather than to start . Week-based intervals start on Sunday. E.g. weekly: +1d, +4d is the same as weekly: Mon, Thu , and generates times on Mondays and Thursdays regardless of start . The first generated time is determined by the unit of the INTERVAL without regard to the multiple. E.g. both \u201c2-week: Mon\u201d and \u201c3-week: Mon\u201d start on the first Monday after start , and then generate either every second or every third Monday after that. Similarly, 24-hour: :00 starts with the first top-of-the-hour after start (not with midnight), and then repeats every 24 hours. To start with the midnight after start , use daily: 0:00 . For interval units of a day or longer, if time-of-day is not specified, it defaults to midnight. The time zone of start determines the time zone of the generated times. >>> def show(dates): return [d.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\") for d in dates] >>> start = datetime(2018, 9, 4, 14, 0); # 2pm on Tue, Sep 4 2018. >>> show(SCHEDULE('annual: Jan-15, Apr-15, Jul-15, Oct-15', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-10-15 00:00', '2019-01-15 00:00', '2019-04-15 00:00', '2019-07-15 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('annual: 1/15, 4/15, 7/15', start=start, count=4)) ['2019-01-15 00:00', '2019-04-15 00:00', '2019-07-15 00:00', '2020-01-15 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('monthly: /1 2pm, /15 5pm', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-15 17:00', '2018-10-01 14:00', '2018-10-15 17:00', '2018-11-01 14:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('3-months: /10, +1m /20', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-10 00:00', '2018-10-20 00:00', '2018-12-10 00:00', '2019-01-20 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('weekly: Mo 9am, Tu 9am, Fr 2pm', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-07 14:00', '2018-09-10 09:00', '2018-09-11 09:00', '2018-09-14 14:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('2-weeks: Mo, +1w Tu', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-11 00:00', '2018-09-17 00:00', '2018-09-25 00:00', '2018-10-01 00:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('daily: 07:30, 21:00', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 21:00', '2018-09-05 07:30', '2018-09-05 21:00', '2018-09-06 07:30'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('2-day: 12am, 4pm, +1d 8am', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 16:00', '2018-09-05 08:00', '2018-09-06 00:00', '2018-09-06 16:00'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('hourly: :15, :45', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 14:15', '2018-09-04 14:45', '2018-09-04 15:15', '2018-09-04 15:45'] >>> show(SCHEDULE('4-hour: :00, +1H :20, +2H :40', start=start, count=4)) ['2018-09-04 14:00', '2018-09-04 15:20', '2018-09-04 16:40', '2018-09-04 18:00']","title":"SCHEDULE"},{"location":"functions/#stats","text":"","title":"Stats"},{"location":"functions/#avedev","text":"AVEDEV (value1, value2) # Calculates the average of the magnitudes of deviations of data from a dataset\u2019s mean.

The country argument allows specifying a 2-letter country code (e.g. \u201cUS\u201d or \u201cGB\u201d) for interpreting phone numbers that don\u2019t start with \u201c+\u201d. E.g. PHONE_FORMAT('2025555555', 'US') would be seen as a US number and formatted as \u201c(202) 555-5555\u201d. Phone numbers that start with \u201c+\u201d ignore country . E.g. PHONE_FORMAT('+33555555555', 'US') is a French number because \u2018+33\u2019 is the international prefix for France. The format argument specifies the output format, according to this table: \"#\" or \"NATL\" (default) - use the national format, without the international dialing prefix, when possible. E.g.

Formula Cheat Sheet # Grist has a powerful data engine to calculate the cells of your tables using formulas. Grist formulas are written in Python , the most popular language for data science. We also have a suite of Excel-like functions , with all-uppercase names. Here are some helpful notes: Formulas apply to the entire column Fields are included in formulas as $ColumnID . Python is case-sensitive, including for Grist table and column names. If your column ID is title , the formula will use $title , where both are lowercase. You may write multi-line Python in formulas (use Shift + Enter to add lines), including statements, variables, imports, etc. Grist code runs in a secure sandbox, with no access to anything outside your document.

Math Functions # Simple Math (add, subtract, multiply divide) # Uses + , - , / and * operators to complete calculations. Example of Simple Math # Chestwood Art Studio ships art across the country and has the option of monthly payments over the course of 12 months. We have the subtotal, the tax (based on the state it is shipping to) and Amount Due Monthly. This formula column uses addition, multiplication and division. The formula used here is: ($Subtotal + ($Subtotal*$Tax)) / 12 We add the subtotal to the calculated tax then divide this by 12 months to get our Amount Due Monthly. Troubleshooting Errors # #TypeError : Confirm all columns used in the formula are of Numeric type. max and min # Allows you to find the max or min values in a list. Examples using MAX() and MIN() # MAX() and MIN() when capitalized are spreadsheet functions which require a specific syntax. Spreadsheet formula syntax is summarized in our functions reference . max() and min() in lowercase are Python functions. Max : Classes table of the Class Enrollment template. The formula used in the \u2018Spots Left\u2019 column of the Classes table is: max($Max_Students - $Count, 0) or \"Full\" This formula shows the number of spots remaining in a class, or the text \u2018Full\u2019 when the class is full or oversubscribed. We build a list between the parenthesis consisting of two items: $Max_Students - $Count and 0 . The formula returns whichever is greater. When $Count is less than $Max_Students , the difference $Max_Students - $Count is positive and represents the spots left in the class. When $Count exceeds $Max_Students , then the class is full or oversubscribed, and $Max_Students - $Count is negative. The maximum of a negative number and 0 will be 0, so max($Max_Students - $Count, 0) is 0. This represents a full class. The addition of or \"Full\" is applied when the value is falsy, which means that a 0 is replaced with the text \"Full\" . Min : Contacts table of the Lightweight CRM template. The formula used in the \u2018Due\u2019 column of the Contacts table is: items = Interactions.lookupRecords(Contact=$id, Type=\"To-Do\") return min(items.Date) if items else None Let\u2019s break this down. Interactions.lookupRecords(Contact=$id, Type=\"To-Do\") finds all records in the Interactions table where the Contacts match and the Type is To-Do. This returns a list of records that we assign to the variable items . Next, we use dot notation to find all Dates assigned to the records in our items list. These dates are evaluated to find the minimum date. This is the value that is returned. So, we see the date of the task that is due the soonest. If there are no items in the list, nothing is returned and the field is left blank. In the MAX() example, the list has two items: $Max_Students - $Count and 0 , and the formula returns whichever is greater. In the min() example, the variable items is pulling a list of records based on the lookupRecords arguments, listing the dates, and returning the smallest date. Note that this is a Python function. If we had written the formula as MIN(), a spreadsheet function, the formula would not work because the spreadsheet formula requires a very specific format . Sum # Use the SUM() function when you want to sum a list of values available within a cell. If you want to sum values in a column, use Summary Tables . Example of SUM() # Custom Product Builder template The formula used in the Total Cost column of the Select or Add New Products table is: SUM($Requirements.Cost) The Requirements column is a hidden column in this table. It is a reference list column that pulls data from the Build Requirements table. Our formula uses the Requirements column to access the Build Requirements table then pulls the cost for each record in the table. We use SUM() to sum the costs from each record. Inventory Manager template The formula used in the Received column of the All Products table is: SUM(Incoming_Order_Line_Items.lookupRecords(SKU=$id).Received_Qty) We use the lookupRecords function to find all records in the Incoming Order Line Items table where the SKU matches the SKU in this row then pull the value in the Received Qty column for each of those records. We use SUM() to find the sum of those values. The Qty on Order and Sold columns of the All Products table are also great examples of the SUM() function. Check out another example in our Community Forum: Creating a Sum of Net and Gross profit from multiple tables Comparing for equality: == and != # When comparing for equality in Python, we use == for \u2018equals\u2019 and != for \u2018does not equal\u2019. If $A is 2 and $B is 3, the formula $A == $B would return False , while the formula $A != $B would be True . Examples using == # Inventory Manager template The formula used in the Received Qty column of the Incoming Order Line Items table is: if $Order.Status =='Received': return $Qty else: return None The Order column of the Incoming Order Line Items Table is a reference column that points to the Order Number column of the Incoming Orders table. $Order.Status uses dot notation to pull the value from the Status column of the Incoming Orders table. If the value in this column is equal to Received , the value from the Qty column will be returned. If the value is not equal to Received , nothing is returned. The formula used in the Date Received column of the Create New Order table is: if $Status == \"Received\": return NOW() This is a trigger formula that is triggered when a change is made to the Status column. If the value in the Status column is equal to Received , the current date is returned. If the values are not equal, nothing is returned. Examples using != # Project Management template The formula used in the Missed Deadline column of the Missed Deadline table is: TODAY()> $Due_Date and $Status != \"Completed\" If the current date is greater than the date given in the Due Date column and the value in the Status column is not equal to Completed , the formula is True . If either of these statements is false, the formula is False . Comparing Values: < , > , <= , >= # Allows you to compare numerical values. If Sales is equal to 1200 and Running_Cost is equal to 1650 , \"Gains\" if $Sales > $Running_Cost else \"Loss\" would return Loss . Examples comparing values # Inventory Manager template The formula used in the Stock Alert column of the All Products table is: if $In_Stock + $QTY_on_Order > 5: return \"In Stock\" if $In_Stock + $QTY_on_Order > 0: return \"Low Stock\" else: return \"OUT OF STOCK\" Here, we have two different if-return statements; if x is true, return some_value . Once a statement is true and a value is returned, the formula stops. If both are false, OUT OF STOCK is returned. First, if the value in the In Stock column plus the value in the Qty On Order column are greater than 5, return \u201cIn Stock\u201d. Next, if the value in the In Stock column plus the value in the Qty On Order column are greater than 0, return \u201cLow Stock\u201d. It\u2019s implied that the value is less than or equal to 5 because the first statement would have to be false for this to be evaluated. Last, if all statements are false, return \u201cOUT OF STOCK\u201d. Internal Links Tracker for SEO template The formula used in the Orphaned? column of the Orphaned Pages table is: len(Links.lookupRecords(To=$id))<1 We use the lookupRecords function to find all records in the Links table where the link in the To column matches the link listed in the Slug column of this row. We use len() to count the number of records found. If it\u2019s less than 1, the formula is evaluated to be true and the checkbox will be checked. If it\u2019s equal to or greater than 1, the formula is evaluated to be false. Converting from String to Float # String : A sequence of characters or snippets of text. In code, strings are quoted e.g. 'Hello' or \"-12\" (those are three characters in quotes, as opposed to a negative number). See Python str() Function for converting a specified value to a string. Float : Real numbers that can store decimal values. Also called floating point number. See Python float() Function for converting a specified value into a floating point number. Integer : A whole number, without decimals. See Python int() Function for converting a specified value to an integer number. Example converting a string to a float # Artwork Orders The formula used in the Sale Price column is: if $Appraisal_Value.endswith(\"k\"): return float($Appraisal_Value.rstrip(\"k\")) * 1000 return float($Appraisal_Value) In this example, the Appraisal Value column is a text column that contains alpha-numeric characters. In order to use this value in mathematical formulas, we need to convert from string to float. If the value in the Appraisal Value column ends with \u201ck\u201d, we first use rstrip() to strip \u201ck\u201d from the string in the Appraisal Value column. Now that we only have numeric characters, we use float() to convert our string to a float. Because K represents 1000 and we have removed this from the value, we multiply our float by 1000. If the value in the Appraisal Value column does not end with \u201ck\u201d, and only contains numeric characters, we can simply use float() to convert our string to a float. Troubleshooting # if you are trying to use different columns with numeric values in a mathematical formula but seeing an error, check the column types for each of the columns used in the formula. All need to be of type Numeric . float() is only needed when dealing with alpha-numeric values like we see in the example . TypeError: can\u2019t multiply sequence by non-int of type \u2018float\u2019 This error occurs when a formula attempts to multiply values from multiple columns, at least one of which is not a Numeric type column. In the screenshot below, the Tax column is a Text column. When we change the column type to Numeric , the error is resolved. TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: \u2018float\u2019 and \u2018str\u2019 This error occurs when a formula attempts to divide values from multiple columns, at least one of which is not a Numeric type column. In the example seen above, the \u2018# of Payments\u2019 column is a Choice column. When we change the column type to Numeric , the error is resolved. TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: \u2018float\u2019 and \u2018str\u2019 This error occurs when a formula attempts to add values from multiple columns, at least one of which is not a Numeric type column. In the example seen above, the Tax column is a Text column. When we change the column type to Numeric , the error is resolved. TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: \u2018float\u2019 and \u2018str\u2019 This error occurs when a formula attempts to subtract values from multiple columns, at least one of which is not a Numeric type column. In the example seen above, the Discount column is a Text column. When we change the column type to Numeric , the error is resolved. Rounding Numbers # Specify the number of decimal places to give in a result using the ROUND() function. If Average Temperature is equal to 46.5 , ROUND($Average_Temperature) would return 47 Example of rounding numbers # Payroll template The formula used in the Payment column is: ROUND($Hours*$Per_Hour, 2) The ROUND() function follows the format ROUND(value, places) which will round the given value to the number of places specified. Our formula finds the value for $Hours*$Per_Hour then rounds this value to 2 decimal places. Mixing Products The formula used in the Rounded Value column is: mix_list_str = $Mix_Product.Lt_per_100_Lt mix_list_float = [float(i) for i in mix_list_str] x = [Lt * $Water/100 for Lt in mix_list_float] round_x = [ROUND(num, 2) for num in x] l = $Mix_Product.Product ' '.join('{} {}'.format(first, second) for first, second in zip(l, round_x)) Let\u2019s break this down. $Mix_Product represents the Mix Product column, a reference list column that pulls data from the Product column of Table1. We can use this column as a link to Table1 to pull other data. $Mix_Product.Lt_per_100_Lt uses the reference list column, Mix Product, to pull values from the Lt per 100 Lt column of Table1 for the products listed in the Mix Product column of Table2 then assigns this list of values to the variable mix_list_str . This is the same formula used in the Lt per 100 Lt column of Table2 so you can see the value it returns in row 1 of Table2. It returns a list: ['0.2355', '1.2579'] . This list is evaluated as a string rather than numerical values. We need to convert each value in this list to a float. In our next formula, [float(i) for i in mix_list_str] , we iterate through the list that was assigned in the first equation to mix_list_str and convert each value to a floating-point number. We want to convert to a float rather than integer because not all values are whole numbers and contain decimals. i is a variable representing each value. So each value in mix_list_str is evaluated in the equation float(i) . float(0.2355) converts 0.2355 to a float and float(1.2579) converts 1.2579 to a float. Now, we assign our list of floats to the variable mix_list_float . We can now use our float values in a mathematical equation. Once again, we iterate through the list that was assigned to the variable mix_list_float . In our equation [Lt * $Water/100 for Lt in mix_list_float] , Lt represents each value in mix_list_float and $Water represents the value found in the Water column which is 1000 . We evaluate the equation Lt * 1000/100 when Lt = 0.2355 and Lt = 1.2579 which returns the list [2.355, 12.579] . We assign this list to the variable x . To round the values in x to two decimal places, we need to evaluate the equation ROUND(num, 2) where num represents each value in our list and 2 specifies the number of decimal places we want to round to. This returns the list [2.36, 12.58] which we assign to the variable round_x. In the first equation, we used our reference list column, Mix Product, as our link to Table1 in order to pull data from Table1 into Table2. We use this method again in $Mix_Product.Product to pull data from the Product column of Table1. This returns a list of products; [Prod A, Prod B] . We assign this list to the variable l . Finally, we use the join() method to combine our two lists. ' ' is our starting (empty) string. We use Python\u2019s format method to format our string. {} is a placeholder for each variable listed in .format() . Last, we use Python\u2019s zip() function to pair the first values from each list together and then pair the second values in each list together. l is assigned as our first list and round_x is assigned as our second list. l = [Prod A, Prod B] and round_x = [2.36, 12.58] . Zipping our lists into '{} {}'.format(first, second) gives us Prod A 2.36 in our first iteration and Prod B 12.58 in our second iteration. Our final return value is Prod A 2.36 Prod B 12.58 . Formatting numbers with leading zeros # Allows you to specify the minimum number of digits returned in a numerical column by adding leading zeros. If x = 5, str(x).zfill(3) or '{:0>3}'.format(x) would return 005 . Formatting numbers with leading zeros # Community Example: Using Row ID The formula used in the 5-digit ID column of the ID Examples table is: 'TCH{:0>5}'.format($id) '{:0>5}'.format($id) takes the unique row ID and formats it to be a minimum of 5 digits. We then add this to our string \"TCH\" to get our final value. If the $id is longer than 5 digits, the formula returns the string unmodified. We can do the same thing using the str.zfill() method. The formula used in the zfill Method column of the ID Examples table is: str($id).zfill(5) str($id) converts the row ID to a string. .zfill(x) returns a copy of the string with leading zeros to make a string of length x . In our example, it adds leading zeros to make the string 5 characters in length. Again, if the $id is longer than 5 digits, the formula returns the string unmodified. Troubleshooting Errors # #TypeError : can only concatenate str (not \u201cint\u201d) to str If you mean to combine a string and a numerical value, be sure to convert it to string using str() . Working with Strings # Combining Text From Multiple Columns # Method 1: If you have a First Name column and a Last Name column, you can combine these columns to have a Full Name column. If First Name is George and Last Name is Washington , $First_Name + \" \" + $Last_Name would return George Washington . Method 2: If you have additional formatting, an easier way to do this would be using Python\u2019s String format() method . The format() method formats the specified value(s) and inserts them in place of the placeholder, {} . Using the same example as above, our formula would be \"{} {}\".format($First_Name, $Last_Name) . Note: You can click on columns to insert them into your formulas, rather than typing them in. Examples using Method 1 # Class Enrollment template{:target=\u201d_blank\u201d} The formula used in the Full Name column of the Students table is: $Last_Name + \", \" + $First_Name Here, we are combining the value found in the Last Name column with a comma followed by a space followed by the value from the First Name column. When adding any extra characters or spaces, place these between double quotes, as we did in the example with \", \" . An alternative combination of these columns for Full Name could be $First_Name + \" \" + $Last_Name . For the example in row 1, First Name is Brockie and Last Name is Raddon so the value returned would be Brockie Raddon . Inventory Manager template The formula used in the SKU column of the All Products table is: $Brand.Brand_Code+\"-\"+$Color.Code+\"-\"+$Size Brand is a reference column that pulls data from the Name Brand column of the Add Products table. We use this reference column in $Brand.Brand_Code to pull data from the Brand Code column of the Add Products table. Color is a reference column that pulls data from the Color column of the Color table. We use this reference column in $Color.Code to pull data from the Code column of the Color table. Each of the values found in $Brand.Brand_Code and $Color.Code are combined with the value in the Size column with a - between each of the three values to make up the SKU. Examples using Method 2 # Tracking Time + Invoicing template The formula used in the Project Name column of the Projects table is: \"{}: {}\".format($Client.Name, $Name) Let\u2019s break this down. Everything between double quotes \" is our string. The curly brackets {} are placeholders for the values found using .format() which is Python\u2019s string format() method. The first set of curly brackets are replaced with the value found in $Client.Name . Client is a reference column that pulls data for a specific record from the Clients table. $Client.Name is using our reference column, Client to pull data from the Name column of the Clients table. The second set of curly brackets are replaced with the value found in the Name column of this table. Although the Client column shows the value that we want, we can\u2019t use $Client like we did $Name . This is because the Client column is a reference column. It is referencing the entire record but uses the value from the Name column of the Clients table as a visual representation of that record. Under the column configuration panel on the right hand side, we can change what column value we see for the record. In the screenshot below, \u2018Show Column\u2019 was changed from Name to Email. It doesn\u2019t change the data, it just changes the label on that data in the Client column. It\u2019s still pointing to the same record but now shows a different label. $Client.Name pulls the Name for the record that is referenced in the Client column, regardless of the label we see. Custom Product Builder template The formula used in the All Components column of the CONTRACT_BUILDER Card is: '\\n'.join(sorted( \"{} \u2014 {:g} {}\".format(comp.Component, quantity, comp.Unit) for (comp, quantity) in $Components.items() )) We are using the join() method , sorted() function and format() method method all in one! '\\n'.join() adds a new line between each item in the list. sorted() sorts the items in the list alphabetically. This leaves us with the following: \"{} \u2014 {:g} {}\".format(comp.Component, quantity, comp.Unit) for (comp, quantity) in $Components.items() We\u2019ll work through this backwards. First, we need to take a look at the Components column which is a hidden column in the All Contracts table. This column is a list of components and their associated quantities for the contract. In the for loop, we assign each item in the list of components two variables, comp and quantity. For Components[3]: 6.0 , comp = Components[3] and quantity = 6.0 . Components[#] specifies a Component in the Components table by Row ID. Components[3] is the component assigned 3 as it\u2019s row id. Now, we run each item from the list above through the equation \"{} \u2014 {:g} {}\".format(comp.Component, quantity, comp.Unit) . comp.Component replaces the first set of {} . comp is the variable with our component ID so comp.Component finds the value in the Component column associated with that row ID. For Components[3] , comp.Component is Nozzle. quantity replaces the second set of {} . Again, the quantity is the second variable in our list. For Components[3]: 6.0 , quantity is 6.0 . Our second set of {} are not empty. They include :g *. This converts the value to a floating-point number. comp.Unit replaces the last set of {} . comp is the variable with our component ID so comp.Unit finds the value in the Unit column associated with that row ID. For Components[3] , comp.Unit is None . *Note that {:g} formats floating point numbers in a particular way that omit decimals when they aren\u2019t needed. There are many options available within placeholders for formatting numbers, dates, etc. Learn more about placeholders here . Email Contacts template The formula used in the Body column of the Advanced Compose table is: \"Dear %s,\\n\\nWelcome to the %s team!\" % ($Contact_Name_as_Plaintext, $Team) This technique uses the % operator instead of the format() method. Format specifiers begin with % followed by a character that represents the data type. %s is a placeholder for a string. The first %s is replaced with the value found in the \u201cContact Name as Plaintext\u201d column which is a hidden column and the second %s is replaced by the value in the Team column. \\n adds a new line. Splitting Strings of Text # Split a string using Python\u2019s split() method. If Full Name is George Washington , $Full_Name.split(\" \") would return [George, Washington] . Example of Splitting Strings of Text # Community Example: Colors The formula in the \u201cColor Reference (Just URL)\u201d column of Table 2 is: split = $Color_Reference.Color.split(\" \") return split[-1] $Color_Reference.Color uses the reference column, \u201cColor Reference\u201d to pull data from the table it is referencing, Table 1. Specifically, it pulls the value from the Color column of Table 1. Color is a text column that contains a hyperlink with a label. We only see the label in Table 1 but as you can see in the screenshot above, the value in the \u2018pink\u2019 cell is expanded to show the entire string which contains \u201cpink\u201d followed by the URL. You can also see this in the \u201cColor Reference\u201d column of Table 2. We want to get the link by itself in \u201cColor Reference (Just URL)\u201d. We can do this using Python\u2019s split() method. .split(\" \") allows us to split the string anywhere there is a space (\" \") . In the Color column, there is a label followed by a space followed by the URL. The value from the Color column is split into a list containing two items Label and URL . This list is assigned to the variable split . We want to return the last item in the list split in order to get our URL . The last item in a list always has index [-1] . return split[-1] returns the last item in the list split .

Read about it in the Community: Pull up Gmail history for a particular contact Troubleshooting # Is your URL still showing after you added a label? Make sure your Column Type is Text and Cell Format is Hyperlink. Joining a List of Strings # When you want to join a list of strings, you can use Python\u2019s join() method . Example of Joining a List # Community Example: .join() Example The formula used in the Advertisement column of the 2022 Grand Openings table is: \"Coming soon to a city near you!\\n\" + \" : \".join($New_Location_s_in_2022) Here, we are joining multiple strings to create our advertisement. \"Coming soon to a city near you!\\n\" is returned almost exactly as we see it, minus the quotes \"\" and \\n at the end of the string. The quotes \"\" specify that this is a string and \\n is actually a newline character that can be used to specify a new line within a string. \" : \".join($New_Location_s_in_2022) is also a string but uses Python\u2019s join() method to join values from our choice list column, \u201cNew Locations in 2022\u201d. What we see in quotes before .join is what will separate each value in our list. In this example, each value is separated by a space, : and another space. Finding Duplicates # You can find duplicates in a column using either conditional formatting or a helper column. Read about it in the Community: Ensure unique values or detect duplicates Example of Finding Duplicates # Community Example: Finding Duplicates The formula used in the Duplicate? column of the Duplicates table is: len(Duplicates.lookupRecords(Grocery_List=$Grocery_List))>1 Let\u2019s break this down, working from the inside > out. Duplicates.lookupRecords(Grocery_List=$Grocery_List) This is a lookupRecords function that follows the format of: [Table_Name].lookupRecords([A]=$[B]) Where [Table_Name] is the name of the table you want to lookup data in. [A] is the column in the table being looked up (named at the beginning of the formula) and [B] is the column in the current table / the table you are entering the formula in. This formula looks up records in the Duplicates table where a record in the Grocery List column matches another record in the same column. len() counts the number of records in our list. Since each duplicate will match with the other, it should appear twice in our list. This is why len() > 1 . if len() > 1 , the formula is true. If len() <= 1 , the formula is false. This same formula can be used in conditional formatting. This can be seen in the \u2018Grocery List\u2019 column of the Duplicates table. If len() > 1 , our formula is true and the conditional cell color is applied to these cells. If len() <= 1 , our formula is false and the cell color is unchanged. Using a Record\u2019s Unique Identifier in Formulas # When a record is created, it is assigned a numeric id (available as $id in formulas) that is unique within that table. You can reveal the row ID by adding a formula column where the formula is $id . Examples Using Row ID in Formulas # You can reveal the ID with the formula $id Custom Product Builder template The formula used in the Contract No. column of the Contract Builder table is: $id + 500 Here, we are using a trigger formula to create a unique Contract Number when a record is created. Class Enrollment template The formula used in the Count column of the Classes table is: len(Enrollments.lookupRecords(Class=$id, Status=\"Confirmed\")) This is refered to as a Reverse Lookup. We can use the row id to match a record in another table where a reference column is used. LookupRecords follows the format [Table_Name].lookupRecords([A]=$[B]) . [Table_Name] is the name of the table you want to lookup data in. [A] is the column in the table being looked up (named at the beginning of the formula) and [B] is the column in the current table / the table you are entering the formula in. Lookup Records creates a list of records that match the criteria listed. len() counts how many records are in that list. Here, we are looking up records from the Enrollments table where the record called out in the Class column (our reference column) has the same row ID as the row in the table you are entering the formula. Additionally, the value in the Status column of the Enrollments table is Confirmed . We\u2019ll walk through this. The table we are looking up records in is the Enrollments table. Our criteria comes from the Class column and the Status column.The criteria for Status is straightforward; the value must be Confirmed in order to be included in our list of records. Class is a bit more complicated. As we see in the screenshot below, Class is a reference column that pulls data from the Classes table. Here, the Class column shows 2018F-Stars . A reference column points to the entire record, not just the value you see here in the Class column. Using the configuration panel on the right hand side of the screen, you can pick any column from the originating table to show. For this example, the Class column shows the value from the Class Code column of the Classes table but it points to the entire record where the class code is 2018F-Stars . As you can see in this screenshot, the Row ID for this particular record is 2 and because we are calculating the Count for the row with Row ID = 2 , it will count all records in the Enrollment table where Class shows 2018F-Stars and Status is Confirmed . Restaurant Custom Orders template The trigger formula used in the BOM # column of the Bill of Materials table is: MAX(o.BOM_ for o in Bill_Of_Materials.all if o.id != $id) + 1 First, we\u2019ll walk through the formula inside the parenthesis then work outwards. Here, o is a variable representing each record in our table. o.BOM_ represents the BOM # for each record and o.id represents the row ID for each record. This is a for loop that makes a list of the BOM # for each record in the table Bill of Materials when the record ID does not equal the ID of this row. MAX() finds the maximum BOM # in the list then + 1 to get our final value. This is a trigger formula that only applies to new records. When a new record is created, the formula finds the highest BOM # in the table then adds 1 so we have a unique BOM # for the new record. Removing Duplicates From a List # You can remove duplicates from a list with help from Python\u2019s set() method. Example of Removing Duplicates from a List # Community Example: Removing Duplicates From a List The formula in the All Divisions column of the Abroad Trips table is: confirmed_div = $Attending_Confirmed.Role_Division.Division pending_div = $Attending_Pending.Role_Division.Division full_list = confirmed_div + pending_div return sorted(set(full_list)) We will walk through this one line at a time. Attending-Confirmed is a Reference List column that pulls data from the EMPLOYEES table. $Attending_Confirmed.Role_Division pulls the value from the Role Division column of the EMPLOYEES table. The Role Division column in the EMPLOYEES table is a reference column itself, which points to a record in the Divisions table. Chaining allows us to specify what information we want from this record. In this case, we want the Division. We expand our formula to $Attending_Confirmed.Role_Division.Division . The Division is found for each employee listed in the Attending-Confirmed column, creating a list. We assign this list of divisions to the variable confirmed_div . Attending-Pending is also a Reference List column that pulls data from the EMPLOYEES table. $Attending_Pending.Role_Division.Division does the same as above except now we pull the division for each employee in the Attending-Pending column. We assign this list to the variable pending_div . We create a list of all divisions by adding the two lists together and assigning this combined list to the variable full_list . return sorted(set(full_list)) first uses Python\u2019s set() method to create a list with no duplicate divisions. We then use the sorted() method to return our set of divisions, sorted alphabetically. Note that the formula above can be simplified even further to: sorted( set($Attending_Confirmed.Role_Division.Division) | set($Attending_Pending.Role_Division.Division) ) Setting Default Values for New Records # You can set default values for when a new record is created and save yourself the trouble of having to fill in the same fields with the same values time after time. Read about it in the Community: Default values on the widget Working with dates and times # Automatic Date, Time and Author Stamps # You can automatically add the date or time a record was created or updated as well as who made the change. Examples of Automatic Date, Time and Author Stamps # Grant Application Tracker template The formula used in the Last Updated column of the Tasks table is: NOW() This is a trigger formula that triggers when a change is made to any field for this record. When a change is made, this formula runs its calculation. NOW() calculates the current time and date for the time zone selected. The formula used in the Created By column of the Tasks table is: user.Name This is a trigger formula that triggers when a new record is created. When the record is created, this formula runs its calculation. user.Name looks up the user account that is logged into Grist and returns the name associated with that account. Troubleshooting Errors # If the time value in your datetime column is not calculating, check your formula. If TODAY() is used in DateTime, the time will always show 12:00am as you see below. NOW() is used for DateTime columns. TODAY() is used for Date. #AttributeError You have likely entered user.name but the formula is user.Name . Keep an eye on capitalization! #NameError You may have entered username or userName . The correct formula is user.Name . Another possibility is that this was entered in as a Formula column rather than a trigger formula column. Convert it to a trigger formula and this should resolve the problem. Filtering Data within a Specified Amount of Time # Using the DATEADD() function and comparision operators , you can determine if a date falls within a specific range then apply a filter. Example Filtering Data that \u2018Falls in 1 Month Range` # Community Example: Filtering Data Within a 1-Month Range The formula used in the Falls in 1 Month Range? column of the Interactions table is: TODAY() >= $Date >= DATEADD(TODAY(),months=-1) TODAY() returns the current date. $Date is the name of a column in our table, which is a Date type column. DATEADD(start_date, days=0, months=0, years=0, weeks=0) returns the date that is the given number of days, months, years, or weeks before or after the start_date . In this example, it returns the date that is one month prior to the start date, TODAY() . This formula is true if the date value in the Date column falls between TODAY() and our DATEADD() date which is one month ago. If the date value in the Date column does not fall between these two dates, the formula returns false. We can use this column to filter our data. If we only want to see interactions that fall within the 1 Month Range, we would filter to only include true values. If we want to see interactions that fall outside of the 1 Month Range, we would filter to only include false values. Troubleshooting Errors # #TypeError : Because $Date is a Date type column, TODAY() must be used in formulas comparing dates. NOW() is a DateTime formula that should only be used with other DateTime values. For example, if the $Date column was a DateTime type column, NOW() would need to be used rather than TODAY() because it includes the time component. NOW() is date and time. TODAY() is only date.","title":"Formula cheat sheet"},{"location":"formula-cheat-sheet/#formula-cheat-sheet","text":"Grist has a powerful data engine to calculate the cells of your tables using formulas.

We build a list between the parenthesis consisting of two items: $Max_Students - $Count and 0 . The formula returns whichever is greater. When $Count is less than $Max_Students , the difference $Max_Students - $Count is positive and represents the spots left in the class. When $Count exceeds $Max_Students , then the class is full or oversubscribed, and $Max_Students - $Count is negative. The maximum of a negative number and 0 will be 0, so max($Max_Students - $Count, 0) is 0. This represents a full class.

Our formula finds the value for $Hours*$Per_Hour then rounds this value to 2 decimal places. Mixing Products The formula used in the Rounded Value column is: mix_list_str = $Mix_Product.Lt_per_100_Lt mix_list_float = [float(i) for i in mix_list_str] x = [Lt * $Water/100 for Lt in mix_list_float] round_x = [ROUND(num, 2) for num in x] l = $Mix_Product.Product ' '.join('{} {}'.format(first, second) for first, second in zip(l, round_x)) Let\u2019s break this down. $Mix_Product represents the Mix Product column, a reference list column that pulls data from the Product column of Table1. We can use this column as a link to Table1 to pull other data. $Mix_Product.Lt_per_100_Lt uses the reference list column, Mix Product, to pull values from the Lt per 100 Lt column of Table1 for the products listed in the Mix Product column of Table2 then assigns this list of values to the variable mix_list_str . This is the same formula used in the Lt per 100 Lt column of Table2 so you can see the value it returns in row 1 of Table2. It returns a list: ['0.2355', '1.2579'] . This list is evaluated as a string rather than numerical values. We need to convert each value in this list to a float. In our next formula, [float(i) for i in mix_list_str] , we iterate through the list that was assigned in the first equation to mix_list_str and convert each value to a floating-point number. We want to convert to a float rather than integer because not all values are whole numbers and contain decimals. i is a variable representing each value. So each value in mix_list_str is evaluated in the equation float(i) . float(0.2355) converts 0.2355 to a float and float(1.2579) converts 1.2579 to a float. Now, we assign our list of floats to the variable mix_list_float . We can now use our float values in a mathematical equation. Once again, we iterate through the list that was assigned to the variable mix_list_float . In our equation [Lt * $Water/100 for Lt in mix_list_float] , Lt represents each value in mix_list_float and $Water represents the value found in the Water column which is 1000 . We evaluate the equation Lt * 1000/100 when Lt = 0.2355 and Lt = 1.2579 which returns the list [2.355, 12.579] . We assign this list to the variable x . To round the values in x to two decimal places, we need to evaluate the equation ROUND(num, 2) where num represents each value in our list and 2 specifies the number of decimal places we want to round to. This returns the list [2.36, 12.58] which we assign to the variable round_x. In the first equation, we used our reference list column, Mix Product, as our link to Table1 in order to pull data from Table1 into Table2. We use this method again in $Mix_Product.Product to pull data from the Product column of Table1. This returns a list of products; [Prod A, Prod B] . We assign this list to the variable l . Finally, we use the join() method to combine our two lists. ' ' is our starting (empty) string. We use Python\u2019s format method to format our string. {} is a placeholder for each variable listed in .format() . Last, we use Python\u2019s zip() function to pair the first values from each list together and then pair the second values in each list together. l is assigned as our first list and round_x is assigned as our second list. l = [Prod A, Prod B] and round_x = [2.36, 12.58] . Zipping our lists into '{} {}'.format(first, second) gives us Prod A 2.36 in our first iteration and Prod B 12.58 in our second iteration.

The first set of curly brackets are replaced with the value found in $Client.Name . Client is a reference column that pulls data for a specific record from the Clients table. $Client.Name is using our reference column, Client to pull data from the Name column of the Clients table. The second set of curly brackets are replaced with the value found in the Name column of this table. Although the Client column shows the value that we want, we can\u2019t use $Client like we did $Name . This is because the Client column is a reference column.

'\\n'.join() adds a new line between each item in the list. sorted() sorts the items in the list alphabetically. This leaves us with the following: \"{} \u2014 {:g} {}\".format(comp.Component, quantity, comp.Unit) for (comp, quantity) in $Components.items() We\u2019ll work through this backwards. First, we need to take a look at the Components column which is a hidden column in the All Contracts table. This column is a list of components and their associated quantities for the contract. In the for loop, we assign each item in the list of components two variables, comp and quantity. For Components[3]: 6.0 , comp = Components[3] and quantity = 6.0 . Components[#] specifies a Component in the Components table by Row ID. Components[3] is the component assigned 3 as it\u2019s row id. Now, we run each item from the list above through the equation \"{} \u2014 {:g} {}\".format(comp.Component, quantity, comp.Unit) . comp.Component replaces the first set of {} . comp is the variable with our component ID so comp.Component finds the value in the Component column associated with that row ID. For Components[3] , comp.Component is Nozzle. quantity replaces the second set of {} . Again, the quantity is the second variable in our list. For Components[3]: 6.0 , quantity is 6.0 . Our second set of {} are not empty. They include :g *. This converts the value to a floating-point number. comp.Unit replaces the last set of {} . comp is the variable with our component ID so comp.Unit finds the value in the Unit column associated with that row ID. For Components[3] , comp.Unit is None . *Note that {:g} formats floating point numbers in a particular way that omit decimals when they aren\u2019t needed.

When you apply a suggested formula, you will see the formula previewed in the column. If you are happy with the formula, click \u201cSave\u201d. Otherwise click \u201cCancel\u201d to discard changes to the formula. AI Assistant for Self-hosters # For self-hosters looking to connect their Grist instance, set the AI Assistant-related environment variables . The above variables also enable the use of the LLaMA family of self-hostable models via llama2-cpp-python . Learn more about self-managing Grist . Pricing for AI Assistant # Free personal and free team plans have 100 AI Assistant credits (or requests). For free team sites, that applies to the whole team. Pro plans include 100 AI Assistant credits per month. The credits automatically top up to 100 every billing cycle. Credits apply to the whole team. It costs one credit per chat message sent. If you need more credits, there are two upgrade options: 500 monthly credits for $10 per month (per team, not per person) 2,000 monthly credits for $29 per month (per team, not per person) Best Practices # It helps to understand how formulas work in Grist, especially when compared to traditional spreadsheets. In Grist, a single formula applies to a whole column. If you\u2019ve worked with spreadsheets before, you may be surprised that you don\u2019t need to specify row numbers, like B1 * C1 . If you\u2019re new to Grist, you might want to try something simple without the assistant to see how formulas behave, e.g. $Price * $Tax . Setting a column header before submitting a question improves results. For example, \u201cNet Profit\u201d provides more context than a column labeled \u201cD\u201d. Set the column type of the formula column before asking the assistant for help. This helps the assistant guess what type of values you\u2019d like returned. Think about the type of value you expect to see in the formula, and frame the question with that in mind. For example, if you want a formula that returns True or False in a Toggle column , ask a yes-or-no question. Otherwise, the assistant may suggest a formula that lists all rows where something is true (and is technically correct), but you were hoping for a simple true or false per row. The assistant is conversational. If you are not satisfied with a suggested formula, explain to the assistant where the formula fell short and ask it to make a change. Sometimes the assistant gets stuck on a bad idea. If it keeps insisting on a particular formula method, consider clearing the conversation and starting over. Click the three dot menu in the AI Assistant header to clear a conversation. Remember that Grist formulas apply to the whole column. If you want sums of rows, you need a summary table . You may add more formulas to summary tables, and ask the assistant to help you. Data Use Policy # Your query and document schema are sent to OpenAI .

For example, to filter column pet for values cat and dog , the filter would be {\"pet\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"]} . JSON contains characters that are not safe to place in a URL, so it is important to url-encode them. For this example, the url-encoding is %7B%22pet%22%3A%20%5B%22cat%22%2C%20%22dog%22%5D%7D . See https://rosettacode.org/wiki/URL_encoding for how to url-encode a string, or https://www.urlencoder.org/ to try some examples. Multiple columns can be filtered. For example the filter for pet being either cat or dog , AND size being either tiny or outrageously small , would be {\"pet\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"], \"size\": [\"tiny\", \"outrageously small\"]} . sort string Example: sort=pet,-age Order in which to return results. If a single column name is given (e.g. pet ), results are placed in ascending order of values in that column. To get results in an order that was previously prepared manually in Grist, use the special manualSort column name. Multiple columns can be specified, separated by commas (e.g. pet,age ). For descending order, prefix a column name with a - character (e.g. pet,-age ). To include additional sorting options append them after a colon (e.g. pet,-age:naturalSort;emptyFirst,owner ). Available options are: choiceOrder , naturalSort , emptyFirst . Without the sort parameter, the order of results is unspecified. limit number Example: limit=5 Return at most this number of rows. A value of 0 is equivalent to having no limit. hidden boolean Set to true to include the hidden columns (like \"manualSort\") header Parameters X-Sort string Example: pet,-age Same as sort query parameter.

Request Body schema: application/json The records to add or update. Instead of an id, a require object is provided, with the same structure as fields . If no query parameter options are set, then the operation is as follows. First, we check if a record exists matching the values specified for columns in require . If so, we update it by setting the values specified for columns in fields . If not, we create a new record with a combination of the values in require and fields , with fields taking priority if the same column is specified in both.

Data records can refer to these using a column of type Attachments . List metadata of all attachments in a doc get /docs/{docId}/attachments https://{subdomain}.getgrist.com/api /docs/{docId}/attachments Authorizations: ApiKey path Parameters docId required string A string id (UUID) query Parameters filter string Example: filter={\"pet\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"]} This is a JSON object mapping column names to arrays of allowed values. For example, to filter column pet for values cat and dog , the filter would be {\"pet\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"]} . JSON contains characters that are not safe to place in a URL, so it is important to url-encode them. For this example, the url-encoding is %7B%22pet%22%3A%20%5B%22cat%22%2C%20%22dog%22%5D%7D . See https://rosettacode.org/wiki/URL_encoding for how to url-encode a string, or https://www.urlencoder.org/ to try some examples. Multiple columns can be filtered. For example the filter for pet being either cat or dog , AND size being either tiny or outrageously small , would be {\"pet\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"], \"size\": [\"tiny\", \"outrageously small\"]} . sort string Example: sort=pet,-age Order in which to return results. If a single column name is given (e.g. pet ), results are placed in ascending order of values in that column. To get results in an order that was previously prepared manually in Grist, use the special manualSort column name. Multiple columns can be specified, separated by commas (e.g. pet,age ). For descending order, prefix a column name with a - character (e.g. pet,-age ). To include additional sorting options append them after a colon (e.g. pet,-age:naturalSort;emptyFirst,owner ). Available options are: choiceOrder , naturalSort , emptyFirst . Without the sort parameter, the order of results is unspecified. limit number Example: limit=5 Return at most this number of rows. A value of 0 is equivalent to having no limit. header Parameters X-Sort string Example: pet,-age Same as sort query parameter. X-Limit number Example: 5 Same as limit query parameter.

Grist can be connected to thousands of other services via integrators with Grist support. These include: Zapier Integrately Pabbly Connect KonnectzIT n8n Make Configuring Integrators # Each integrator provides its own way to configure the connection between Grist and other services. Pabbly Connect has created a few videos walking through how to set up an integration with Grist using Pabbly Connect. Pabbly Connect Youtube - Grist Playlist Included below is a walkthrough of an example of how an integration with Grist can be configured using Zapier . Grist can trigger a workflow whenever there is a new or updated record in a table, leading to action in another service. Conversely, workflows triggered by other services can consult, add, or update records in Grist tables. Example: Storing form submissions # Suppose we have a form for collecting votes on the color of a proposed new bike shed: The form is set up using Google Forms (for this example), and we want the responses to be stored in a Grist document: One way to make this happen is with Zapier . So let\u2019s sign in on the Zapier site and then visit the Grist integration page : We\u2019d like to pair Grist with Google forms. Zapier supports several form providers, and the overall process for integration is similar for them all. Just type in the provider you want. For this tutorial, we\u2019re going with Google forms. Once we\u2019ve picked the provider to integrate with, we need to pin down exactly what we want it to do, from the available \u201ctriggers\u201d and \u201cactions.\u201d In this case, we choose that when there is a New Response in Spreadsheet trigger for Google Forms, we will do the Create Record action in Grist. We click the build button to start filling in the details: Since the triggering event for the integration will happen in Google Forms, we are first asked to give Zapier some access rights to your forms. Once that is done, we are prompted to confirm which spreadsheet to use: Then we specify which worksheet within the spreadsheet to use (easy if there is just one). For Zapier\u2019s benefit in a later step, it is important that there be at least one sample response already in the spreadsheet. That\u2019s the Google side done. Now for the Grist side. We are prompted to give an API key for Grist, so we set up an API key if we haven\u2019t already. To give precise access rights, we could set up a user account just for the integration, and give it access to just what it needs, and supply its API key. Now we confirm the team to use - personal docs or a team site we have access to: Then we pick the Grist document to send form responses to: And then we pick the table to use within that document. It should have columns to store whatever parts of the form we want to keep. It is important to make this table if it doesn\u2019t exist already; it won\u2019t be created automatically. It isn\u2019t important to match column names with questions. Zapier allows for flexible mapping of fields between services. In our case, a one-to-one mapping works fine: Ok! Now we can click our button to have Zap test our integration. All going well, we can turn the \u201cZap\u201d on and leave it run. Now is the time to try making some submissions, and go have a cup of something. Free \u201cZaps\u201d may run periodically to check for new submissions, so don\u2019t expect immediate results in all cases. But eventually, you should see the votes pouring in! Example: Sending email alerts # We\u2019ve seen an example of an outside service sending data to Grist. Now let\u2019s look at an example of Grist sending data to an outside service. Continuing our form example, where a Grist document is accumulating votes for a preferred color: now suppose that every time a new vote comes in we want to send an email summarizing which option is in the lead. We write a formula to prepare the text in a Text cell: Let\u2019s return again to the Grist integration page on Zapier. There are several mail integrations. For this example, we pick Gmail: Once we\u2019ve picked the service to connect, now we choose exactly what we want it to do. In this case, we choose that when there is a New or Updated Record (Instant) in Grist, we will Send Email in Gmail. Note the Instant there. Triggers in Zapier can be either a regular kind where Zapier periodically checks for changes (this is relatively slow), or a special \u201cinstant\u201d kind that needs special support from the triggering service but is a lot faster. Grist supports either kind of trigger, and we strongly recommend \u201cinstant\u201d if you prefer results in seconds rather than minutes, and especially if you are the sort to get anxious if someone doesn\u2019t respond to your IMs immediately. Once we\u2019ve chosen a Grist account to use as before, we can pick a table within a document to monitor. For instant triggers, we can optionally specify a \u201creadiness\u201d column . If we leave this blank, anytime a record is created or changed in the selected table, Grist will notify Zapier about it. If we set it, it should generally be to a toggle column , and Grist will notify Zapier only for records when that column is turned on. That is handy for records that have many columns being filled in manually, when we don\u2019t want to trigger until they are complete. For this example, it is fine to leave the readiness column blank. (For regular non-instant triggers, we would need to pick a specific column to monitor. Ideally this would be an Updated At column, see Timestamp columns ). On the Gmail side, we can email to pre-set addresses, or this could be configured dynamically (we\u2019ll see an example of how in a moment): We choose to set the body of the email to contain \u201cCustom\u201d content, in this case the Text cell we calculated earlier. And we\u2019re done! Zapier will offer to make a quick test that emails go out correctly: Then you can make some votes and watch the system work. For instant triggers, results should show up fairly snappily. Otherwise, Zapier has a \u201crun zap\u201d functionality to force an integration to update immediately: And emails should start showing up in the desired inboxes. May the best almost indistinguishable shade win! Readiness column # Grist has a mechanism for alerting other services when data changes within a document. This serves as the basis for Zapier instant triggers. Since Grist is a spreadsheet, it is common for records (rows) to be created empty, and for cells to then be filled in one by one. This creates an important nuance for notifications. Usually it won\u2019t be desirable to send a notification until the record is in some sense \u201cready\u201d, but when exactly is that? Grist lets the user decide for themselves, by creating a toggle (boolean) column which is turned on when the record is ready. The column can be set manually, or via a formula. This is called a readiness column. For example, if you only want to activate a trigger when columns called Name and Email are not empty, your readiness column can have the following formula: bool($Name and $Email) You would make the column take effect by supplying it in the Readiness column option described in the email alert example . Triggering (or avoiding triggering) on pre-existing records # The order of steps matters when setting up an integration that uses a readiness column. If you have existing data, think through whether you want the integration to affect all existing data or just updates and new data. For example, if you are sending data from Grist to Google Sheets using a Zapier integration, you\u2019ll probably want to send your existing data. In this case, set up and enable your Zap first with an empty readiness column, then turn on all the readiness cells. If you want to send a notification only when something is added to Grist, and not for pre-existing records, make sure your readiness cells are all turned on prior to enabling the integration, otherwise once they are turned on notifications will be sent for all of them. That may be a lot!","title":"Integrator services"},{"location":"integrators/#integrator-services","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

How do I set up snapshots? How do I control telemetry? How do I upgrade my installation? What if I need high availability? The essentials # What is Self-Managed Grist? # There are four flavors of Grist: SaaS (Software as a Service): Grist is available as a hosted service at docs.getgrist.com . No installation needed. Free and paid plans, with usage limits. Desktop App : Grist is available as a desktop application, built with Electron. It is available for download at https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-desktop/releases . This desktop application does not need internet and is not tied to any online account or service. Self-Managed Enterprise : Grist is available as a licensed application installed by enterprises on their own infrastructure with our support and backing. Contains proprietary features developed for enterprises with particular needs. Self-Managed Core : Grist is available as a free application installed by citizen developers on their own infrastructure with community support. Grist documents created with our SaaS and Enterprise offerings can be opened and edited with Core, and vice versa. This establishes Grist documents as a reliable format for archiving and interchange. Self-Managed Grist, be it Enterprise or Core, is installed and configured in much the same way, as described in the following sections. For clarity, the sections are tagged with which flavor they apply to, for example: The full source code for Grist Core is always available at github.com/gristlabs/grist-core and is under an Apache-2.0 license. You may use and redistribute Core freely, under the terms of the free software license. The full source for Grist Enterprise is also available, at github.com/gristlabs/grist-ee , under a proprietary license that does not grant any automatic rights to use or redistribute the software. You can evaluate Enterprise for 30 days using the instructions in the following sections, or sign up for our Grist Enterprise plan and get support. How do I install Grist? # The easiest way to install Grist is as a container. We will describe how using Docker , but there are many other tools and services for running containers. To try Grist out using Docker, make an empty directory for Grist to store material in (say ~/grist ) and then for Grist Core you can do: docker run -p 8484:8484 \\ -v ~/grist:/persist \\ -e GRIST_SESSION_SECRET=invent-a-secret-here \\ -it gristlabs/grist For Grist Enterprise use gristlabs/grist-ee instead of gristlabs/grist . You should then be able to visit http://localhost:8484 in your browser. Already you will be able to create and edit Grist documents, and to open and edit documents downloaded from another Grist installation (such as our SaaS). If using some other tool or service, here are the important points: The container name is gristlabs/grist or gristlabs/grist-ee (for some tools, you may need to prefix these names with docker.io/ ). A volume (or mount, or directory) needs to be available at location /persist within the container. It can be initially empty - Grist will populate it. Without this volume, nothing you do will be stored long-term. Port 8484 on the container needs to be exposed. This can be changed if you also set the PORT environment variable for the container. The environment variable GRIST_SESSION_SECRET should be set to something secret for the container. Installed this way, Grist is accessible only to you. Typically you want to take at least the following steps: Set up sandboxing - this is important to place bounds on what formulas can do. Serve from a public host so you can collaborate live with others. Enable an authentication method so users can log in. Often you\u2019ll want to hook Grist up to an \u201cSSO\u201d (Single Sign-On) service you already use. We support some very general authentication methods that cover many cases, and a special authentication method for custom cases. Consider enabling snapshot support if you want Grist to handle document backups. Grist on AWS # You can also host Grist on AWS. Full instructions on this hosting method are available on the Grist AWS Marketplace page . How do I sandbox documents? # Grist allows for very powerful formulas, using Python. We recommend setting the environment variable GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR to gvisor if your hardware supports it (most will), to run formulas in each document within a sandbox isolated from other documents and isolated from the network. docker run ... -e GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR=gvisor \\ ... To sanity-check that formulas are being evaluated within a sandbox, you can create a document and then check that this formula gives an empty result: import glob glob.glob('/etc/*') Here are some reasons why gvisor sandboxing, as configured for Grist, may fail, and what you can do to diagnose the problem. XSAVE not available # Your processor may not be supported. On x86_64 , Sandy Bridge or later is needed. Check that the XSAVE processor flag is set. Here\u2019s a quick way to test that: grep -q '\\bxsave\\b' /proc/cpuinfo && echo \"XSAVE enabled\" || echo \"XSAVE missing\" PTRACE not available # The SYS_PTRACE capability may not be available. If running in docker, you could try explicitly granting it, if you are comfortable with making it available: docker run ... --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE ... In some cloud environments such as AWS ECS, you may need to explicitly list this capability in your container configuration. How do I run Grist on a server? # We suggest that you become familiar with all the other aspects of self-management on this page before serving Grist from a public host (especially Sandboxing ). When you do, it is important to tell Grist where it will be served from, using the APP_HOME_URL variable. For example, if you will be serving from https://grist.example.com , let Grist know like this: docker run ... -e APP_HOME_URL=\"https://grist.example.com\" \\ ... You will need to place a \u201creverse proxy\u201d in front of Grist to handle \u201cSSL termination\u201d (decrypting encypted traffic) using a certificate that establishes ownership of the site. If you don\u2019t know what this means, you could try using the Grist Omnibus which packages Grist with a reverse proxy that will use Let\u2019s Encrypt to get a certificate for you automatically. An important job of such a proxy is to correctly forward websocket connections. This amounts to two requirements: Ensure that the proxy is using HTTP 1.1 Pass the necessary Upgrade, Connection, and Host HTTP headers so that an HTTP connection can be upgraded to a websocket connection. For example, here is a minimal configuration for nginx , a possible choice for reverse proxy. server { server_name grist.example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8484; proxy_redirect off; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # WebSocket support proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\"; } } This configuration will handle basic HTTP traffic and websockets. It still requires additional SSL/TLS configuration. A simple option for self-hosting on a small scale is to use certbot by the EFF . How do I set up a team? # Grist has a concept of \u201cteam sites\u201d that are independently managed and named areas containing their own workspaces and documents. Team sites can have distinct subdomains (as on our SaaS\u2019s hosted team sites ), or be distinguished by a special path prefix. This often does not make sense for self-managed installations, where there is a single team. With a single domain and a single team, the special path prefix (which looks like /o/<team-name> ) is an inelegant waste of space in URLs. So you can direct Grist to use a single team by setting GRIST_SINGLE_ORG (\u201corg\u201d or \u201corganization\u201d is a synonym for team): docker run ... -e GRIST_SINGLE_ORG=cool-beans The name of the team should use only the lower-case characters a-z, the digits 0-9, and the hyphen ( - ). You may also want to look into Custom styling to hide any UI elements you don\u2019t need. How do I set up authentication? # Authentication can be set up in many ways for Grist Core and Enterprise, using SAML, OpenID Connect or forwarded headers. Between the two, many popular SSOs can be hooked up, such as Google or Microsoft sign-ins. SAML . OpenID Connect Forwarded headers . For any authentication method, you may want to also consider setting the following variables: COOKIE_MAX_AGE : (optional) expiration date for Grist session cookie, when set to none session cookie will be in a Session mode - it should be removed after closing a browser. If set to a number, the units of the number are milliseconds. GRIST_FORCE_LOGIN : (optional) when set to true this will instruct Grist to redirect anonymous users to a login page. For our SaaS, we use a custom authentication system based around AWS Cognito. Currently, we have no plans to release that as part of Core or Enterprise. Are there other authentication methods? # If users on your site login via WordPress, or via a custom mechanism you developed, you may want to consider GristConnect , available for Grist Enterprise. How do I activate Grist Enterprise? # Activation keys are used to run Grist Enterprise after a trial period of 30 days has expired. Get an activation key by signing up for Grist Enterprise . You don\u2019t need an activation key to run Grist Core. Place the contents of your activation key in an environment variable called GRIST_ACTIVATION , or place it in a directory available to Grist and provide the full path to the file with the environment variable GRIST_ACTIVATION_FILE . Without the activation key, there will be a banner stating that Grist is in trial mode. Once the activation key is detected, this banner will go away. Replacing the activation key will require restarting Grist. docker run ... -e GRIST_ACTIVATION=<activation-key-goes-here> \\ -it gristlabs/grist-ee Customization # How do I customize styling? # The Grist UI has many elements, some of which may not be relevant to you. For self-managed installations of Grist, you can turn off many elements using GRIST_HIDE_UI_ELEMENTS . This is comma-separated list of parts of the UI to hide. The allowed names of parts are: helpCenter,billing,templates,multiSite,multiAccounts . The UI elements present are also affected by whether GRIST_SINGLE_ORG is set. docker run ... -e GRIST_HIDE_UI_ELEMENTS=helpCenter,billing,templates,multiSite,multiAccounts \\ ... By default pages of the Grist UI have - Grist added to their title. You can change this by setting GRIST_PAGE_TITLE_SUFFIX : docker run ... -e GRIST_PAGE_TITLE_SUFFIX=\" - Cool Beans\" \\ ... You can set the suffix to \"_blank\" to entirely remove it. You can also override the CSS styling of the site if you set APP_STATIC_INCLUDE_CUSTOM_CSS to true . docker run ... -e APP_STATIC_INCLUDE_CUSTOM_CSS=true \\ ... This will load an extra custom.css file. You can find an example of such a file in the Grist Core repository . The file includes most of our global CSS variables for colors, and a few variables for the logo shown in the top-left corner. There\u2019s really no limit to what can go in the file, so specifying arbitrary styles is possible. Note that all CSS rules should use !important to make sure they have the highest precedence. Otherwise, it\u2019s possible for more specific rules included by our framework to take precedence. To override custom.css , you can make your own copy and make sure Grist uses it. If the CSS file is in your current directory, then do: docker run ... -v $PWD/custom.css:/grist/static/custom.css ... It is possible to direct Grist to load static resources from a CDN by setting APP_STATIC_URL . If you do so, and you are using custom CSS, you\u2019ll need to ensure the custom CSS is available from that base URL. How do I list custom widgets? # In our SaaS, Grist has a list of pre-built custom widgets available in the UI. You can have your self-managed installation offer the same list by setting the following: docker run ... -e GRIST_WIDGET_LIST_URL=\"https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget/releases/download/latest/manifest.json\" \\ ... This is optional. If you leave the variable unset, documents with custom widgets will still work fine, but you\u2019ll need to enter a full URL when adding custom widgets rather than picking an option from a drop-down. You can make your own list of widgets available by forking github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget or by manually preparing a .json file on a public server in the same format as our manifest.json . How do I set up email notifications? # In Grist SaaS, we send emails such as invitations to share a document using SendGrid . The same mechanism is available in Grist Enterprise. There is not yet an equivalent in Grist Core. You will need to set a SendGrid API key: docker run ... -e SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.XXXXXXX.XXXXX \\ ...

These are for on-going automated emails that are sent to all users who are enrolled in a particular list. sendgrid.list.singleUserOnboarding - New Grist users are automatically added to this list on first-login. This is suitable for sending regular onboarding emails to users. sendgrid.unsubscribeGroup - Maps email types to SendGrid unsubscribe group ids. These are for allowing users to unsubscribe from receiving certain types of emails (via the link in the email). sendgrid.unsubscribeGrist.invites - If set, invite emails can be suppressed via the unsubscribe link in emails. sendgrid.unsubscribeGrist.billingManagers - If set, emails sent specifically to billing managers (e.g. membership changes) can be suppressed via the unsubscribe link in emails. For reference, there are example SendGrid templates in example-sendgrid-templates.zip based on an export of the SendGrid templates for our SaaS. How do I add more python packages? # The set of python packages available for use in formulas is currently not configurable. You can add packages anyway if you are willing to build and install your own version of the Grist. Warning Grist documents made on an installation with custom python packages will not bring those packages with them if copied to a different installation. Formulas using custom python packages will give errors when those packages are unavailable. Create an empty directory, and add the following into it, in a file called Dockerfile : FROM gristlabs/grist # or grist-ee, or grist-omnibus RUN \\ apt update && apt install -y openssl && \\ python3 -m pip install phonenumbers Replace phonenumbers with the python package or packages you want to install. You can now build your custom Grist image by running a docker build in the directory with Dockerfile in it: # replace \"custom\" with a username or organization name. docker build -t custom/grist . Once done, you can use custom/grist in place of gristlabs/grist(-ee) in How do I install Grist , and your python library will now be available to import in formalas. If you want the import done automatically, so you don\u2019t have to do it in formulas, currently that requires a code change to sandbox/grist/gencode.py . If you are comfortable making code changes, then the build instructions of the grist-core repository are the place to start. Operations # What are the hardware requirements for hosting Grist? # For hosting Grist as a Linux container, here is a known good configuration for a variety of moderate workloads: 8GB RAM 2 CPUs 20GB disk Grist is packaged for the following CPU architectures: x86_64 (Sandy Bridge or later if sandboxing is enabled) ARM64 Every Grist document is a separate database, so it is difficult to state absolute minimum requirements without knowing what documents will be used. In tests, the Investment Research template runs comfortably served from a Grist container with: 100MB RAM without sandboxing enabled. 200MB RAM with sandboxing enabled. 1 CPU. Memory and CPU requirements will scale with the number of documents simultaneously in use by your team. Sandboxing is an important issue in serving Grist. It is achieved using gvisor . Sandboxing depends on the availability of particular capabilities, and may be unavailable in environments that deny or lack these capabilities. Grist sandboxing is known to work in the following environments: Regular unprivileged docker containers with default security settings. AWS EC2 instances. AWS Fargate containers, with SYS_PTRACE set in linuxParameters.capabilities . Grist sandboxing has been reported to fail to initialize on older Intel processors that do not support the XSAVE feature (supported by Sandy Bridge and later). What files does Grist store? # When installed as a container, Grist expects to have access to a persistent volume, or a directory shared with the host, in which it stores everything that needs to last beyond a container restart. Concretely, if you started Grist exactly as described in How do I install Grist , that directory would be ~/grist . Here\u2019s what you would find there: A subdirectory called docs , containing *.grist files. These are Grist documents. Grist documents are SQLite databases, so you can inspect these files with the standard sqlite3 utility. You can also upload them to another installation of Grist (such as our hosted service) and view/edit them there. If you move or rename these files, Grist will no longer recognize them. If snapshot support is configured, there will be extra files alongside each .grist file for tracking its storage state. A file called grist-sessions.db . This contains information to support browser sessions with Grist. It is a SQLite database. If redis is configured , that is used instead of this file. A file called home.sqlite3 . This contains information about teams, workspaces, and documents (metadata only, such as names, rather than document contents such as tables and cells). It is a SQLite database. It is called the home database and if PostgreSQL is configured that is used instead of this file. If using Grist Omnibus, there are other files, including: An auth directory, with a SQLite database for tracking login state, and a store of any certificates created. A param directory, with secrets invented for the installation. What is a \u201chome\u201d database? # Grist stores metadata about users, documents, workspaces, etc in a database called the \u201chome\u201d database. This does not contain the material inside documents such as tables and columns, but does contain document names and creation times, for example. By default, Grist will create a home database in an Sqlite file within the /persist directory. To use instead a PostgreSQL database, create the database along with a user with sufficient access to create tables, and set the following variables: TYPEORM_TYPE - set to postgres TYPEORM_DATABASE - set to name of database, e.g. home TYPEORM_USERNAME - set to postgres username with rights to the database TYPEORM_PASSWORD - set to postgres password with rights to the database TYPEORM_HOST - set to hostname of database, e.g. grist.mumble.rds.amazonaws.com TYPEORM_PORT - set to port number of database if not the default for PostgreSQL Grist is known to work with PostgreSQL from versions 10 through 14 (later versions are likely to work also, but have not been specifically tested at the time of writing). What is a state store? # Grist can be configured to use Redis as an external state cache. For most Grist functionality, this is optional. It is required for webhook support, and recommended for snapshot support. To use, just set REDIS_URL to something like redis://hostname/N where N is a redis database number. docker run ... -e REDIS_URL=\"redis://hostname/N\" ... How do I set up snapshots? # Grist\u2019s cloud storage feature allows automatic syncing of Grist documents and document versions to an S3-compatible bucket (available for all Grist versions) or to Azure storage (in Enterprise Grist). Here is an example of running Grist locally, with snapshots stored in a test MinIO instance: # Make a network docker network create grist # Start Redis in our network (recommended for snapshots) docker run --rm --network grist --name redis redis # Start MinIO in our network docker run --rm --network grist --name minio \\ -v /tmp/minio:/data \\ -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \\ -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=grist -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=admingrist \\ -it minio/minio server /data -console-address \":9001\" # Visit http://localhost:9000 and set up a bucket called grist-docs. # Make sure to enable versioning on the bucket. # Hook Grist up to Redis and MinIO docker run --rm --network grist \\ -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=grist \\ -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_SECRET_KEY=admingrist \\ -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_USE_SSL=0 \\ -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_BUCKET=grist-docs \\ -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_ENDPOINT=minio \\ -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_PORT=9000 \\ -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis \\ -v /tmp/grist:/persist -p 8484:8484 -it gristlabs/grist Here are flags to make Grist talk to an AWS S3 bucket using the MinIO client: ... -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \\ -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_SECRET_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \\ -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_ENDPOINT=s3.amazonaws.com \\ -e GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_BUCKET=grist-docs \\ ... As per MinIO specs .), the default bucket region is us-east-1 . This default region can be overwritten using the GRIST_DOCS_MINIO_BUCKET_REGION flag. For details, and other options, see Cloud Storage . How do I control telemetry? # By default, Grist installations do not \u201cphone home\u201d to any central service. It is useful to permit them to do so, to give Grist Labs some limited insight into your usage, through measurements called telemetry. This will help guide development, and draw attention to self-managed users as a group. The simplest way for an owner of a Grist installation to opt in to sending telemetry to Grist Labs is to click the \u201cOpt in to Telemetry\u201d button on the \u201cSupport Grist\u201d banner on the main page of the installation. If you do not wish to opt in, you can dismiss the banner. The banner is shown only to the owner of the installation. The owner of the installation is the user whose email address matches the GRIST_DEFAULT_EMAIL environment variable (if set). You can control telemetry at any time using the \u201cSupport Grist\u201d page, if you are the owner of the installation. Rather than using buttons to opt in to telemetry, you may set the environment variable GRIST_TELEMETRY_LEVEL to limited . This has the same effect as the \u201cOpt in to Telemetry\u201d button. The GRIST_TELEMETRY_LEVEL environment variable, if set, takes priority over any setting made interactively. Recommended values are limited or off . In either case, read limited telemetry for exact details of what data is sent, and telemetry overview for further explanation. An interactive method for controlling telemetry is only available for Grist Core builds currently. In all cases, the default is to not send telemetry. How do I upgrade my installation? # We currently release new Grist Core and Enterprise images at approximately weekly intervals. Grist handles any migrations that may be needed to the documents or databases it uses. Utilities such as Watchtower can keep your version of Grist up to date for you. What if I need high availability? # We have developed expertise in hosting very busy Grist installations, with many users, including how to upgrade with minimal disruption, and how to scale out to handle heavy load. We would be happy to help Enterprise clients with needs of this nature.","title":"Self-managed Grist"},{"location":"self-managed/#self-managed-grist","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

No installation needed. Free and paid plans, with usage limits. Desktop App : Grist is available as a desktop application, built with Electron. It is available for download at https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-desktop/releases . This desktop application does not need internet and is not tied to any online account or service. Self-Managed Enterprise : Grist is available as a licensed application installed by enterprises on their own infrastructure with our support and backing. Contains proprietary features developed for enterprises with particular needs. Self-Managed Core : Grist is available as a free application installed by citizen developers on their own infrastructure with community support. Grist documents created with our SaaS and Enterprise offerings can be opened and edited with Core, and vice versa. This establishes Grist documents as a reliable format for archiving and interchange. Self-Managed Grist, be it Enterprise or Core, is installed and configured in much the same way, as described in the following sections. For clarity, the sections are tagged with which flavor they apply to, for example: The full source code for Grist Core is always available at github.com/gristlabs/grist-core and is under an Apache-2.0 license. You may use and redistribute Core freely, under the terms of the free software license. The full source for Grist Enterprise is also available, at github.com/gristlabs/grist-ee , under a proprietary license that does not grant any automatic rights to use or redistribute the software. You can evaluate Enterprise for 30 days using the instructions in the following sections, or sign up for our Grist Enterprise plan and get support.","title":"What is Self-Managed Grist?"},{"location":"self-managed/#how-do-i-install-grist","text":"The easiest way to install Grist is as a container. We will describe how using Docker , but there are many other tools and services for running containers. To try Grist out using Docker, make an empty directory for Grist to store material in (say ~/grist ) and then for Grist Core you can do: docker run -p 8484:8484 \\ -v ~/grist:/persist \\ -e GRIST_SESSION_SECRET=invent-a-secret-here \\ -it gristlabs/grist For Grist Enterprise use gristlabs/grist-ee instead of gristlabs/grist . You should then be able to visit http://localhost:8484 in your browser. Already you will be able to create and edit Grist documents, and to open and edit documents downloaded from another Grist installation (such as our SaaS). If using some other tool or service, here are the important points: The container name is gristlabs/grist or gristlabs/grist-ee (for some tools, you may need to prefix these names with docker.io/ ). A volume (or mount, or directory) needs to be available at location /persist within the container. It can be initially empty - Grist will populate it. Without this volume, nothing you do will be stored long-term. Port 8484 on the container needs to be exposed. This can be changed if you also set the PORT environment variable for the container. The environment variable GRIST_SESSION_SECRET should be set to something secret for the container. Installed this way, Grist is accessible only to you. Typically you want to take at least the following steps: Set up sandboxing - this is important to place bounds on what formulas can do. Serve from a public host so you can collaborate live with others. Enable an authentication method so users can log in. Often you\u2019ll want to hook Grist up to an \u201cSSO\u201d (Single Sign-On) service you already use. We support some very general authentication methods that cover many cases, and a special authentication method for custom cases.

When you do, it is important to tell Grist where it will be served from, using the APP_HOME_URL variable. For example, if you will be serving from https://grist.example.com , let Grist know like this: docker run ... -e APP_HOME_URL=\"https://grist.example.com\" \\ ... You will need to place a \u201creverse proxy\u201d in front of Grist to handle \u201cSSL termination\u201d (decrypting encypted traffic) using a certificate that establishes ownership of the site. If you don\u2019t know what this means, you could try using the Grist Omnibus which packages Grist with a reverse proxy that will use Let\u2019s Encrypt to get a certificate for you automatically. An important job of such a proxy is to correctly forward websocket connections. This amounts to two requirements: Ensure that the proxy is using HTTP 1.1 Pass the necessary Upgrade, Connection, and Host HTTP headers so that an HTTP connection can be upgraded to a websocket connection. For example, here is a minimal configuration for nginx , a possible choice for reverse proxy. server { server_name grist.example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8484; proxy_redirect off; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # WebSocket support proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\"; } } This configuration will handle basic HTTP traffic and websockets.

Memory and CPU requirements will scale with the number of documents simultaneously in use by your team. Sandboxing is an important issue in serving Grist. It is achieved using gvisor . Sandboxing depends on the availability of particular capabilities, and may be unavailable in environments that deny or lack these capabilities. Grist sandboxing is known to work in the following environments: Regular unprivileged docker containers with default security settings. AWS EC2 instances.

Concretely, if you started Grist exactly as described in How do I install Grist , that directory would be ~/grist . Here\u2019s what you would find there: A subdirectory called docs , containing *.grist files. These are Grist documents. Grist documents are SQLite databases, so you can inspect these files with the standard sqlite3 utility. You can also upload them to another installation of Grist (such as our hosted service) and view/edit them there. If you move or rename these files, Grist will no longer recognize them. If snapshot support is configured, there will be extra files alongside each .grist file for tracking its storage state. A file called grist-sessions.db . This contains information to support browser sessions with Grist. It is a SQLite database. If redis is configured , that is used instead of this file. A file called home.sqlite3 . This contains information about teams, workspaces, and documents (metadata only, such as names, rather than document contents such as tables and cells). It is a SQLite database. It is called the home database and if PostgreSQL is configured that is used instead of this file.

GristConnect # Discourse is popular forum software made to be integrated with many sites (including our own ). It is annoying if users need a login for a forum that is separate to their login on the rest of a site. The protocol Discourse created for solving this is quite well done and is called DiscourseConnect . We decided to have Grist support the same protocol, so any software that has plugins for letting Discourse use its logins (such as WordPress) can also let Grist use its logins. This isn\u2019t an official standard so we called our implementation of it \u201cGristConnect\u201d rather than \u201cDiscourseConnect\u201d. Setting up GristConnect requires some settings for Grist, and a plugin or custom coding for your site or SSO. The Grist settings are as follows: GRIST_CONNECT_URL : setting this environment variable will enable GristConnect. It should be an URL address of an external site where users will be redirected on login/signup request. GRIST_CONNECT_SECRET : (required) a secret key, used to sign (hash) query parameters in URLs used during login flow. GRIST_CONNECT_LOGOUT_URL : (optional) an URL address users will be redirected to after signing out. By default - Grist\u2019s existing sign-out page. GRIST_CONNECT_ENDPOINT : (optional) a callback endpoint exposed by Grist where users should be redirected to after a successful login attempt in the external Identity Provider site (default value: /connect/login ). For your site or SSO, you may find that the software you use supports DiscourseConnect, in which case you can enable that and coordinate with the Grist settings. Otherwise, here are the exact details of what needs to happen: When users try to login into Grist, they are redirected to a GRIST_CONNECT_URL with signed query parameters, for example, https://auth-provider.example.com?sso=PAYLOADBASE64&sig=cAlculateDHash The payload is a Base64 encoded query string containing: nonce - a one time token generated by Grist return_url - a URL to redirect the user to after successful login - this always will be set to the full Grist URL for GRIST_CONNECT_ENDPOINT . User should sign in using the GRIST_CONNECT_URL login screen. An external provider should create a new url-encoded payload with the following parameters nonce - (required) a token that was sent from Grist external_id - (required) any string that is unique to the user and will never change email - (required) a valid user email name - (required) a user name avatar_url - (optional) an URL to user\u2019s profile photo. Note that Grist will also accept picture parameter for the same purpose. This payload should be base64 encoded and properly escaped to be a valid query string. A provider should calculate a HMAC_SHA256 hash of a payload. A user should redirect to the GRIST_CONNECT_ENDPOINT endpoint with a signed query string parameters, for example, https://grist.customhost.com/connect/login?sso=ENCODEDPAYLOD&sig=HASH Grist will create a new user or update an existing one.

AWS Marketplace # Grist on the AWS Marketplace has what you need to run a self-hosted Grist instance with minimal setup, and is based on grist-omnibus . Below are the complete configuration steps, including authentication via OpenID. First run setup # After deploying the instance, Grist should be instantly available through the HTTP protocol on an autogenerated domain such as ec2-3-94-254-105.compute-1.amazonaws.com (labeled Public IPv4 DNS by AWS). Default credentials: email: admin@example.getgrist.com password: [instance-id]* * Instance ID can be found on the EC2 page in the AWS Console: How to log in to the Grist instance # During deployment, you should have been asked about creating or using key pairs. You can use this pair to log in via SSH from your terminal/bash. The default user for the Grist EC2 instance is named \u201cubuntu\u201d, and you can log in to ubuntu@[ec2-instance-public-ip] . Note: You need to use the *.pem file you received while generating key pairs on AWS. Details about connecting via SSH can be found in the following places: Windows: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/ssh Linux: https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/command macOS: https://www.servermania.com/kb/articles/ssh-mac If you don\u2019t want to connect via SSH, AWS provides the option to connect from within the AWS console using the \u201cConnect\u201d button: Custom domain and SSL setup for HTTPS access # Custom domains are required for secure access to Grist. If you already have an SSL certificate, you can use your own (as described in the grist-omnibus README ). If not, Grist can generate a certificate from Let\u2019s Encrypt. For that, a valid domain and email must be configured: Point the domain to the IP address of the Grist EC2 instance. If you don\u2019t use the Elastic IP service , the instance can have a different public IPv4 address each time it\u2019s started. Log in to the Grist EC2 instance. Set the URL parameter in the grist/gristParameters file. You need administrator privileges to perform this action, so you can open an editor by running sudo nano grist/gristParameters . Run the restartGrist script with sudo ~/grist/restartGrist . Once the above steps are completed, you should be able to access Grist on your custom domain. Authentication setup # We support Google or Microsoft as OpenID providers. For configuring other authentication providers, please refer to the dex documentation . To configure Grist authentication with Google or Microsoft, you must have an application registered with the corresponding provider: Microsoft: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/security/authentication/openid-settings Google: https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en Once you have your client ID and secret, you\u2019ll need to pass them to the gristParameters file inside the Grist EC2 instance: Log in to the Grist EC2 instance. Open ~/grist/gristParameters . Update the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET sections for the relevant provider(s). If you\u2019re using only one provider, leave the second section commented out. Update ADMIN_EMAIL in the same file. It should correspond to the email you will use to log in via your authentication provider. For example: ADMIN_EMAIL=frank@your-organization.com If you want to change your team\u2019s name, update TEAM_NAME in the same file. Run restartGrist with the clean flag using sudo ~/grist/restartGrist clean to clear old login data. Important: This will delete all Grist documents! Once the above has been configured, you should be able to log in with your Google/Microsoft credentials. Running Grist in a separate VPC # grist-omnibus is designed to work on each account-default VPC. To make it run on a custom VPC, you\u2019ll need to properly configure all VPC elements. For more information on this configuration, read here . To run Grist on a VPC, the following must be properly set up: Assigning a public DNS name to the Grist EC2 instance is allowed. The VPC can be accessed from the internet (allowing internet gateway and routing tables to handle traffic). A security group connection from ports 22 (SSH for configuration), 80 (HTTP connection) and 433 (HTTPS connection) is allowed. Updating grist-omnibus # The packaged version of grist-omnibus will auto-update before each launch. To update grist-omnibus manually, restart the Grist EC2 instance or log in via SSH and call sudo ~/grist/restartGrist . There are currently no plans to support the Grist AWS Marketplace environment outside of grist-omnibus . Other important information # The Grist EC2 instance should have the \u201cPersistent store\u201d option checked. Grist stores all the data in the ~/grist-persist directory. Deleting this folder will result in a loss of all data from all documents. Do not delete ~/grist-persist/acme.json , as it contains a private key from Let\u2019s Encrypt.

What\u2019s New # New Grist Business plan # We\u2019ve been working hard to make sure Grist suits larger teams with complex and sensitive data. To address this segment, we\u2019ve updated our Pricing page to include a new Business plan \u2014 with a Self-Managed flavor! We\u2019re hoping this new plan increases the transparency of pricing around Grist deployments that could use more of our support, rather than requiring organizations to reach out directly for pricing info. There\u2019s also a new option to subscribe annually. New Pro subscriptions are now $10 on the monthly plan, but still at $8 if paying annually. Existing Pro subscriptions are not affected by this change. We\u2019ve also updated our Professional Services page to include some new opportunities we have regarding getting expert help building Grist documents. Formula timer # Enough is enough \u2013 it\u2019s time to put your formulas through their paces. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u23f1\ufe0f It\u2019s a common event to see a spreadsheet collapse under its own weight, like a dying star composed of conditionals. Even mighty Grist documents can slow down when the power of Python goes unchecked. But now there\u2019s a way to diagnose your formulas before things go supernova. Introducing the formula timer , which lets you time formulas for specific changes or for a full document reload. For more information, read all about saving milliseconds with the formula timer \u2014 written by one of the newest additions to the Grist Labs team, Jordan! \ud83d\udc4b Ordering conditional styles (with bonus draggability) # You can now easily reorder conditional styles, on both rows and columns! Don\u2019t ask how this was accomplished previously! Self-hosting admin console improvements # Our new admin console is continuing to grow and develop as we work towards our ambitions of easier self-hosting. \ud83d\udd1c The app\u2019s authentication method is now included in the \u201cSecurity Settings\u201d section. If not set up, you\u2019ll be warned. \u270b\ud83e\udd28 Boot panel checks are now visible (and expanded/improved based on your feedback!). We\u2019re still iterating on this, so please let us know on Discord if you have any more feedback. To make the panel more robust, it now honors emergency access via a GRIST_BOOT_KEY setting if authentication is broken, and should even be usable if the app has some common misconfigurations. This means you can count on the admin panel not becoming inaccessible just when you need it most! Community highlights # marc.fargas has provided our community with a excellently detailed walkthrough of his Grist \u2192 PDF rendering pipeline. The solution does require external services (which may not be completely free), but it\u2019s an great example of extending Grist.

To add a section to your form, click the Add New button at the bottom of each section, and then click \u201cInsert section above\u201d or \u201cInsert section below\u201d. Choice and reference select When filling out a form, you can now search for values in long choice and reference select fields, making it easier to find the exact option you\u2019re looking for. Quick embed code If you\u2019d like to embed a form on your website, click the share icon then \u201cEmbed this form\u201d to reveal an embed code. Reset form A new \u201cReset\u201d button is now available on published forms so that form takers can reset a form back to its initial state. Imports and exports - two new file formats! # DOO Separated Values (DSV) Can your spreadsheet DOO this? The DOO Separated Value (DSV) format is an important improvement to Comma Separated Values (CSV), and is now supported for both importing and exporting by Grist. DSV uses a special character from the Unicode astral plane as a separator, to better protect the integrity of your data. Learn how. Credits: DSV was initially proposed by Jamie Matthews . We\u2019ve followed his specification precisely, but changed the file extension to avoid a conflict with Pipe Separated Values (PSV). The value of this specific character from the Unicode astral plane for testing software was first proposed by Mathias Bynens . Tab Separated Values (TSV) You can now export and import data as Tab Separated Values (TSV) from the Share menu. Grist boot page # An early version of a diagnostics page for self-hosted Grist is now available. Learn how to enable it. Migrate from Spreadsheet.com # We\u2019ve built a tool to help you migrate your Spreadsheet.com data into Grist, including attachments and relations, without the need to manually download and upload your files. Check it out here ! Community highlights # @tomnitschke built some new custom widgets, including An auto action widget that lets you automatically run user actions on page load A widget to view PDF and ODT/ODF files directly in the browser A widget to create DOCX or PDF files from HTML or Markdown You can find them all on Github. @jonathanperret built a custom widget that embeds paysage - a collaborative, visual coding playground - into a Grist document.

Forms are almost here, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited. We\u2019ll release a preview version for testing in January, and would love early feedback from users. To provide feedback, join our Discord server. JOIN DISCORD Beta Testing: Grist on AWS Marketplace # In 2024, we plan to release new options for self-hosted Grist, so that it becomes easier to run (and maintain) on your own infrastructure. Self-hosted Grist can already run almost anywhere, especially when someone has done the work of packaging it for your specific environment. One of the first examples of this was Adrian\u2019s Grist package for Unraid , and one of the most recent is Florent\u2019s Grist package for YunoHost from just last month. At Grist Labs, we have started work on a Grist package for the AWS Marketplace, and are seeking friendly users on the AWS cloud to try it out and give feedback. Interested? Please join our Discord and watch for an announcement in January, and thanks! Other improvements # Advanced Charts and the JupyterLite Notebook are now official custom widgets available in the drop-down. In table widgets, you can now hit the spacebar to open the selected row as a record card. Community Highlights # On the Grist Discord , @CoverWhale shared their early-stage Grist Go client, with the delightful name Gorist . Also on the Discord, @jperon shared a pug_py widget to help develop custom widgets. Translation started for Romanian (thanks @chiuta)! See here for more information on translating Grist.

What\u2019s New # Hang out with us on Discord! # We\u2019ve created an official Grist Discord server for those interested in a place to chat about Grist and Grist-related topics. As a fun kickoff, we\u2019re going to see how many of this year\u2019s Advent of Code puzzles we can solve with Grist. \ud83d\udcc6\ud83e\udde9 JOIN DISCORD Record cards # Don\u2019t let the humble name fool you, this is a big one! We all know how helpful references are. But sometimes you want to take a peek at the referenced record without changing your current view. Now you can! The \u201clink\u201d icon in reference and reference list columns is now an actual hyperlink, and it opens the referenced record in a pop-up. But this doesn\u2019t just affect references! You can also view any row in a table as a card with a single click, letting you see its base record in full. Record cards are default card views for every table. They can be configured on the Raw Data page . Add column with type # Our quest to improve the experience of adding new columns continues. Now you can set the column type right in the \u201cAdd Column\u201d menu. Behold! Security update for self-hosters # We released a security fix earlier this month related to the suggested configuration of grist-core with traefik, as well as for grist-omnibus . See this Community update for more details. The fix also affects those who do Grist authentication by forwarding a header for all endpoints (e.g. behind HTTP Basic Auth), as it makes a previously optional flag required. You may need to review your settings \u2013 see this issue for details. Grist Console Q&A # CTO Paul was able to share some fascinating Grist-related nuggets in an excellent Console Q&A . Learn about the origins of the name \u201cGrist\u201d, how (and why) we build Grist, and how we may be able to communicate with extraterrestrials. \ud83d\udc7d (That last one may not be directly related to Grist.) Community Highlights # Self-hosters: Grist now natively supports authentication with OpenID Connect. See the complete documentation here . A huge thanks to @fflorent from ANCT for their work on this PR! Looking for a simpler way to self-host Grist? Florent has also packaged Grist on YunoHost , a Debian-based OS designed to help democratize self-hosting. Check out Florent\u2019s post in our forum for more information. Andreas Kl\u00f6ckner ( @inducer on GitHub) has shared not one, not two, but THREE Grist-related projects on the Community forum : grist-availability : a tool to help with multi-person scheduling using the new calendar widget. grist-mailmerge : a batch emailer driven by a Grist table and a Jinja template. pygrist-mini : a tiny Grist API client for Python. Translations started for Arabic, Czech, Chinese (Traditional), Dutch and Thai! We\u2019re now at 20 languages either complete or in-progress, all thanks to community contributors.

You can also view any row in a table as a card with a single click, letting you see its base record in full. Record cards are default card views for every table. They can be configured on the Raw Data page .","title":"Record cards"},{"location":"newsletters/2023-11/#add-column-with-type","text":"Our quest to improve the experience of adding new columns continues.

July was a big month for Grist, with a brand-new feature that brings a suite of other improvements. As always, we\u2019d love to hear feedback and welcome any examples of cool/useful things you create with Grist. What\u2019s New # AI Formula Assistant # A while ago we did an experiment with AI to see how it could help Grist users with formulas. We\u2019re excited to announce the experiment is now a feature in an integrated AI Formula Assistant ! TLDR: Using plain language, chat with an AI to help create Grist formulas. Grist sends the necessary context, so no need to describe your data\u2019s structure. Because the AI Assistant makes use of Grist\u2019s structure, we strongly recommend reading this quick list of best practices . All Grist accounts get 100 credits for free \u2013 so you can test out the assistant right now! Check out the full announcement . Learn how to use the assistant and how data is handled in our help center . Floating formula editor # Working on complex formulas and feeling a bit cramped? No longer! The AI Formula Assistant brings with it a new floating formula editor. Expand, collapse, and drag the editor around the screen as you please. Just start editing any formula column and hit the expand icon at the top right of the cell. Changes made in the expanded floating editor won\u2019t apply until you hit the Save button. Bonus feature: Preview changes! Click the new Preview button in the floating editor to see how your changes will affect the column in question. Easily test formulas without updating your entire dataset. Your changes won\u2019t apply until you hit Save. \ud83e\udd29 Better handling of emojis on Page names # At Grist we love using emojis as visual shorthand for Page names. They\u2019re easily recognizable, and work well when the Pages panel is minimized. Now, Grist automatically detects when an emoji is used at the start of a name and styles it accordingly. Telemetry for self-hosted users # We rely on product usage data to help make improvements to Grist. Self-hosters can now opt-in to sharing limited telemetry data with us. We only collect usage statistics, never document contents. If you\u2019re a fan of Grist who self-hosts, opting into telemetry is one of the best ways to support us. You can read a detailed list of what we collect in our help center . To opt in, click the opt-in button on the \u201cSupport Grist\u201d banner on your homepage, or modify the GRIST_TELEMETRY_LEVEL environment variable as described in our help center\u2019s telemetry overview . You may opt-out again at any time. Tips & Tricks # Access Rules: Restrict creation of new record until all mandatory fields are filled in # In the Showcase forum, Natalie takes us through how to use Access Rules to restrict a user from creating new records until all mandatory fields are filled in for existing records in a table.

Flashcards Contest: Build the Best Knowledge Deck # In May we\u2019re sponsoring a flashcards contest. Build the best flashcard deck by using our Flashcards Template to share your expertise on any topic. The community will then vote for the top three most mind-blowing flashcard decks. Each of the three winners will receive a rare and highly sought-after Grist thermos . LEARN MORE What\u2019s New # We rickrolled, and so can you # Last month we invited you to answer a Grist survey and rewarded your kindness with an April Fool\u2019s joke: a rickroll in Grist. The great news is that you can pay this forward whenever you like to whomever you like with any document. Take any Grist anchor link and replace the r in the URL with rr. We call it \u201crickrow\u201d because that r anchors to a row. To find an anchor link, right click on any cell and select \u201ccopy anchor link\u201d from the context menu (keyboard shortcut shown in menu). In this case the anchor link is https://templates.getgrist.com/doc/lightweight-crm#a1.s1.r20.c2 To rickrow someone, edit the anchor link to https://templates.getgrist.com/doc/lightweight-crm#a1.s1.rr20.c2 For full rickrolling, be sure the recipient can access the document! Grist-static: Publish data on static sites without embeds # Take a peek at our CTO Paul\u2019s latest experiment. Grist-static offers a way to view and interact with .grist files on regular websites, with no special back-end support needed. Grist-static is great for displaying spreadsheet reports on a website, similar to PDF reports, but better! With grist-static, viewers will be able to change selections, and experiment with changing numbers to see what happens. Every viewer has their own copy, and their changes won\u2019t be seen by others, or stored. This would also be a scalable way to show a Grist document to millions of simultaneous users. See some examples here . Learn more on Github . We want to hear from you. Do you already see a use case for grist-static? Are you excited by it? Tell us by emailing us at support@getgrist.com , or posting in our community forum . This is just the beginning for grist-static and your input helps guide our design. Another werewolf strike: MOONPHASE() # Another function contribution by user @were_functions on Twitter. The MOONPHASE() function returns the phase of the moon on the given date. Here\u2019s what it tells us about the date of this newsletter: MOONPHASE(TODAY()) is \ud83c\udf13. With other arguments, we can find that it\u2019s been 8 days since new moon, or 0.27 of a month. Also that MOONPHASE(TODAY(), \"lunacy\") is \ud83d\udd7a. Safe for now, but it\u2019s less than a week to the next full moon. Someone ought to start taking the wolfsbane potion. Try it yourself! Tip: Replace \u201clunacy\u201d with \u201cdays\u201d to calculate the age of the moon in days, or \u201cfraction\u201d to calculate the fraction of the lunar month since the new moon.

It is a longstanding passion project of his to make Grist a standalone app on Windows, Mac and Linux. Last year, user @stan-donarise worked on a Grist Electron app for Windows 7 or later . Paul took ideas from that effort, from this forum thread , and from an early standalone version of Grist developed at Grist Labs. Check out the Grist Electron app repo on Github .

To set a language, click on your user icon > profile settings > select a language from the drop-down menu. We are so grateful to the volunteers who translated Grist, namely the team at ANCT and Paul Janzen. \ud83d\ude4f The ANCT developers also did the hard work of making a good chunk of the application translatable. Merci bien! Want to help translate Grist? We use Weblate to manage translations and welcome volunteer translators. Thanks to everyone who is pitching in. Expanding Widgets # Working on small screens just got easier! It is now possible to expand widgets by clicking on the expand icon in the top-right corner. View As Another User # Viewing a document as different team members is useful when testing access rules. It is now easier to cycle through members in a \u201cView As\u201d banner without leaving the page. You can also view as a team member from the three-dot menu in the Access Rules button in the left-side panel. Seed Rules for Granular Table Permission # When writing access rules, it\u2019s fairly common to repeat the same rule across many tables \u2014 for example, always grant owners full read and write permissions. There is now a checkbox that will automatically grant owners full access whenever table rules are added. Rules that are automatically added to new table rules are called seed rules. You can modify seed rules and even add memos as needed. One-click Toggle to Deny Editor Schema Permission # By default, editors of a document have schema permissions, which allow them to modify a document\u2019s structure, views, and formulas. Formulas are powerful because a determined user can retrieve information they don\u2019t have access to by using formulas. To protect against that, editors can be denied schema permissions with an additional access rule. We\u2019ve made that easier with a one-click checkbox. Document Settings Have Moved # You can now find document settings in the \u201cTools\u201d section of the left-side panel.

What\u2019s New # New Date Filter with Calendar # Filtering date and datetime columns just got easier. You can now select a date range using a calendar picker. The bounds of the range may also be relative \u2014 for example, from 1st day of this month to Today . The filter will update with each passing day. Snapshots in Grist Core # Previously, snapshots were available on hosted Grist and the self-managed enterprise plan, and relied on commercial cloud storage services. Now, snapshot support is also available on Grist Core \u2014 the open source version of Grist \u2014 and can work with open source self-hosted storage options such as MinIO. \ud83c\udf89 Learn how to set up snapshots . Quick Delete for Invalid Table/Column Access Rules # If there are access rules for a table or column that has been deleted, there is now a convenient button to delete the rules that apply to the deleted column or table. You remain in control of which rules remain and which are deleted, so you don\u2019t have to worry about rules disappearing if you are reorganizing your document. In this example, the Breeder_Retirement column has been deleted, so the column rule for that column should also be deleted. Improved UI for Memo Writing # Access rules now have a memo button to add memos to rules, making writing and editing memos more convenient. Memos can really help colleagues understand why they can\u2019t do something, since memos are shown in a popup when an action is blocked by a rule. Tips # To help you and your teammates get the most out of Grist, there are now tips that appear as you explore Grist\u2019s features. To dismiss all tips, check the \u201cDon\u2019t show tips\u201d checkbox. Open Source Contributions # Thank you to @jperon who created and shared a pivot table custom widget.

Grist Experiment: Writing Python Formulas with AI # We see plenty of Grist power users who use every feature except formulas, which is a shame, but understandable. Formulas can be daunting. Imagine if writing spreadsheet formulas were as simple as asking a question. We recently experimented with OpenAI to see how well AI could write Python formulas in Grist. The experiment yielded promising results which we\u2019re excited to share! While this AI-assisted formula generation feature is not yet a part of Grist, this experiment proves its future value: AI can eliminate a common struggle for today\u2019s spreadsheet user \u2014 writing formulas correctly. Read more about the experiment on our blog. There\u2019s a poll at the end where you can vote for this feature, and sign up for updates about our AI formula generation.

Previously, to create filter buttons above a widget, you could either make all or none of your filters into buttons. Now, you can pin filter buttons individually.

Only one of them, \u201cThank you Sent?\u201d, is pinned as a button for convenience. \u201cInvitation\u201d is not pinned, because it is ensuring that this view only shows guests who RSVP\u2019d yes to the wedding.

What\u2019s New # Raw Data Tables # Introducing the raw data page, a special page that lists all data tables in your document, making it easier for you to find and browse all your data. Learn more. Raw Data has been a long time in coming! In Grist, there has always been a conceptual separation between views and underlying data. As a Grist creator, you have probably found yourself in the shoes of an application developer: at one time thinking about relationships in the data, and separately designing how to present this data in convenient productive views. Raw data makes the separation explicit. It\u2019s a place where you can always find the underlying data, and its structure. When creating pages, your page list can now be limited to only the most useful views, without the clutter of helper tables. Those are still available any time in the raw data view. Linking Referenced Data to Summary Tables # Tables that reference a summary table\u2019s underlying data may now be linked to the summary table itself. API Endpoint GET /attachments # New API endpoint. /attachments will return list of all attachment metadata. Learn more.

Learn more. Raw Data has been a long time in coming! In Grist, there has always been a conceptual separation between views and underlying data. As a Grist creator, you have probably found yourself in the shoes of an application developer: at one time thinking about relationships in the data, and separately designing how to present this data in convenient productive views. Raw data makes the separation explicit. It\u2019s a place where you can always find the underlying data, and its structure. When creating pages, your page list can now be limited to only the most useful views, without the clutter of helper tables. Those are still available any time in the raw data view.","title":"Raw Data Tables"},{"location":"newsletters/2022-05/#linking-referenced-data-to-summary-tables","text":"Tables that reference a summary table\u2019s underlying data may now be linked to the summary table itself.","title":"Linking Referenced Data to Summary Tables"},{"location":"newsletters/2022-05/#api-endpoint-get-attachments","text":"New API endpoint. /attachments will return list of all attachment metadata.

If you know what you need, but need help building it, we\u2019re here to help. Here\u2019s how it works: Eligibility. Anyone with a team site is eligible for the Sprouts program (even while on free trial). Schedule a free 30-minute consultation call. Email success@getgrist.com and describe your use case. We\u2019ll pair you with a Grist expert on our team and schedule a time to meet. On that call, we\u2019ll estimate the scope of the work. For quick projects. If we estimate your project can be completed in less than an hour, we\u2019ll do it ourselves \u2014 for free! Many use cases fall into this category. For larger projects. For projects longer than an hour, we\u2019ll recommend a contractor who has been trained and vetted by Grist, and has quick access to our team. Whether you choose to work with our contractor or with someone else, we\u2019ll schedule one more 30-minute call to make sure everyone understands the project. Based on this, the contractor will estimate the work and quote a price. Visit our website to submit an inquiry! What\u2019s New # Conditional Formatting # Conditional formatting is finally here! \ud83c\udf8a In the creator panel in the column menu, under CELL STYLE you may now add conditional styles. Enter a formula and style the cell\u2019s background and text color. You may add multiple conditional rules. Learn more.

That means less data cleaning when importing new data! \ud83c\udf89 New API Method for Add or Update # We added a new method to update an existing record, or, if it does not exist, add a new one.

If you know what you need, but need help building it, we\u2019re here to help. Here\u2019s how it works: Eligibility. Anyone with a team site is eligible for the Sprouts program (even while on free trial). Schedule a free 30-minute consultation call. Email success@getgrist.com and describe your use case. We\u2019ll pair you with a Grist expert on our team and schedule a time to meet. On that call, we\u2019ll estimate the scope of the work. For quick projects. If we estimate your project can be completed in less than an hour, we\u2019ll do it ourselves \u2014 for free! Many use cases fall into this category. For larger projects. For projects longer than an hour, we\u2019ll recommend a contractor who has been trained and vetted by Grist, and has quick access to our team. Whether you choose to work with our contractor or with someone else, we\u2019ll schedule one more 30-minute call to make sure everyone understands the project. Based on this, the contractor will estimate the work and quote a price.

When creating a reference column it is best practice to choose a display column that is a unique identifier for the record. For example, for records of people, it could be full name or email. To show other data, such as department or birthday, pull it in using the formula $[Reference Column Id].[Referenced Record\u2019s Field] , (for example $Person.Department ). You may review how this formula works in our reference column guide . Labeling hyperlinks with text. In hyperlink columns, you can label a link with text by adding a label before the url: [link label] url . The brackets are not needed. Using Search to Find a Card. If you have a card widget on a page and quickly want to find the right card, you can use the search bar on the page to quickly bring the relevant card into view.

What\u2019s New # Freeze Columns # You can now freeze columns in Grist! Tame those wide spreadsheets and view your data, your way. Read-only Editor # Team members with view-only access can now open a cell editor to more easily read long text, access attachments, or take a peek at formulas. They will still be prevented from editing the cell, as indicated by the gray lock icon. Read-only cell editor locked for edits v. unrestricted cell editor Quick Tips # Duplicate Document v Work on a Copy. When making changes to a document\u2019s structure it\u2019s a good practice to Work on a copy . This does not automatically save a duplicate of your document. It creates an unsaved working copy where you can make edits, and then choose to replace the current document, copy your new edits to a new document, or discard your changes altogether. Duplicate Document does create a new, duplicated document, and you can choose whether or not to copy data or retain only the document\u2019s structure. Exporting Backups. Grist periodically takes snapshots of your documents. You can save any version of your document (current or historical snapshots) to backup your data. To backup historical snapshots, click on Document History then Snapshots . Select any snapshot\u2019s menu then click on Open Snapshot . Click on the share icon to open a menu from which you can download the entire document as a Grist file . Combining text fields with formulas. You may sometimes have text in multiple columns that you would like to display in one column. For example, a table may have first name and last name columns. You may easily create a full name column with the formula \"{}, {}\".format($Last_Name, $First_Name) . The part in quotes is a format string: each set of curly brackets ( {} ) in it gets replaced with the next value from parentheses after format . In this case, the full name would be displayed as Benson, Carla . Dig Deeper # Analyzing Data with Summary Tables and Formulas # Summary tables and formulas are vital tools in capturing actionable insights from your data. They make it possible to group records into specific categories, then compute sums using those record groups. Grist makes it easy to create summary tables and work with the $group field in summary formulas. We\u2019ve created a video tutorial that helps you master two key concepts: summary tables and summary formulas. The tutorial guides you into building two summary pages in an advanced timesheet tracker template. LEARN: Summary Tables New Template # Advanced Timesheet Tracker # The timesheet tracker makes it easier to track contractors\u2019 timesheets across various months and departments. It has a dashboard where contractors can submit their hours directly into Grist, and see only their historical timesheet data. The company\u2019s payroll department can see everyone\u2019s timesheets, in all accounts, across all months, and have access to summary pages that provide useful data around spending. They can also set permissions to allow or disallow timesheet edits in certain months. The summary tables tutorial starts with an unfinished version of the template, and guides you into creating two new pages. If you want to use the completed template, go to the tutorial solution. Note that there are access rules in place for the completed template which will prevent you from seeing certain pages and most data.

When making changes to a document\u2019s structure it\u2019s a good practice to Work on a copy . This does not automatically save a duplicate of your document. It creates an unsaved working copy where you can make edits, and then choose to replace the current document, copy your new edits to a new document, or discard your changes altogether. Duplicate Document does create a new, duplicated document, and you can choose whether or not to copy data or retain only the document\u2019s structure. Exporting Backups. Grist periodically takes snapshots of your documents. You can save any version of your document (current or historical snapshots) to backup your data. To backup historical snapshots, click on Document History then Snapshots . Select any snapshot\u2019s menu then click on Open Snapshot . Click on the share icon to open a menu from which you can download the entire document as a Grist file . Combining text fields with formulas. You may sometimes have text in multiple columns that you would like to display in one column. For example, a table may have first name and last name columns. You may easily create a full name column with the formula \"{}, {}\".format($Last_Name, $First_Name) . The part in quotes is a format string: each set of curly brackets ( {} ) in it gets replaced with the next value from parentheses after format .

Organizing Data with Reference Columns # Reference columns are at the heart of what Grist does best: make it easy to set up a relational database and create highly productive layouts. If you\u2019re not familiar with databases, understanding reference columns can feel a little tricky. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created a simple template you can copy and edit to deepen your understanding of reference columns. In our example, you are a job applicant who uses Grist to track your job application status at multiple companies. You would like a simple dashboard that makes it easy to see your job status at a glance, and to add new jobs, interviews and other milestones. Follow our 3 step guide to learn how to use reference columns . What\u2019s New # Choice Lists # You can now select multiple options in a Choice List column. In the screenshot below, multiple dog shows are selected from a choice list, instead of just one. Search Improvements # When searching in Grist, the search now stays on the same page by default. If you want to search across all pages, simply mark the checkbox. Hyperlinks within Same Document # Previously all hyperlinks opened in a new tab. Now, hyperlinks that point to a different part of the same document will open in the same tab. This makes it easier to jump to relevant parts of large documents. Quick Tips # Adding new record from reference column drop-down list. You may add a new value to the dropdown list in a reference column without switching to the underlying table. Just type in the value you want to add and select the + value in the dropdown list. Grist will automatically add a new record containing this value to the underlying table and insert the proper reference. Edit Card Widget Layout. When converting a table into a card widget, you may want to move fields around to a more intuitive format. Click on the ... menu above the widget you\u2019d like to edit, then select EDIT LAYOUT.

Understanding Link Sharing # Last month we released granular access controls which makes it possible to limit who can see or edit which parts of a document, down to individual columns and rows. This same level of control can be set for documents shared via links with third parties who do not have a Grist account or who are not a part of your organization. For example, you may want to share purchase history with a customer, permit staff to see only their work schedules, or show a client their project\u2019s status. In Grist, \u201clink keys\u201d are URL parameters that when combined with the access control rules will determine which data a link recipient is permitted to view. Creating Unique Link Keys in 4 Steps # The best way to learn is by doing. We\u2019ve created a simple template you can copy and edit to deepen your understanding of link sharing. In our example, you are a private tutor who uses Grist to track hours, payments, and client data. You would like to share session and payment history with parents via a link that only shows their family\u2019s data. Follow our 4 step guide to learn how to share limited data via links . The private tutor can see all data, but a parent can only see their family\u2019s data. Learn How What\u2019s New # You can now create filter buttons in a bar above any view in Grist. The filter bar can be toggled on or off, and edited to only include buttons for those columns you commonly filter by. The bar can also be saved so that everyone with access to the doc can more easily filter data. Quick Tips # Freezing unique identifiers . When using the Grist\u2019s UUID() function, you may want to freeze values assigned to each record. If you don\u2019t, the unique identifier will generate anew when you re-open the doc. To freeze unique identifiers, convert the column to the data column, and set the default formula for new records to UUID() so that new rows will also be assigned a unique identifier. Creating links in cells . To create a column of links in Grist, set the column type to Text, and click the \u201cHyperLink\u201d button under Cell Format. Link Keys and Public Access. If you\u2019re generating unique links to limited views of data, make sure you have turned on Public Access under \u201cManage Users\u201d to allow link-sharing.

Access rules # Grist now offers \u201caccess rules\u201d for fine-grained control of who can see (or edit) which parts of your document at the table, column, and row level. In December, we invited those interested in early access to try the feature out. We\u2019ve made a lot of improvements, and are now excited to open the feature to the public. Things to know about access rules: Until now, everyone you shared a document with saw the same content. Now, their views can be filtered. For example, a table or column may be visible only to certain users. Or some users may see only rows that meet a condition. Until now, all editors and owners of a document could change anything about its content. Now, document owners can control what specific editors can change. For example, a table or column may be locked for certain editors. Or some editors may only update, add, or remove rows that meet a condition. If you need it, editors can be organized into groups or teams using a table within the document itself, and granted permissions systematically. You can make special links to give ad-hoc view access to pieces of the document, including documents shared with the public. Access rules are marked as a Beta feature, meaning that the design of access rules is likely to evolve, and sometimes that will require updates to documents that use them. We won\u2019t make such changes lightly. Grist access rules put great power in your hands. With that power comes great responsibility. Take your time to read our documentation , explore the examples , and test the rules you create . Feel free to reach out to consult us as well, at support@getgrist.com . We\u2019ll be glad to help. New Example # Access rules let you control how a shared document is used, and maintain a separation of roles and responsibilities. In our Lead List example, we suppose an entrepeneur is using Grist as an ad-hoc lead tracker for sales and potential advisors, and show how they can use access rules to shape collaboration. Quick Tips # Cell Color . You can add a splash of color to a column using the Cell Color option for Columns (in tables) or Fields (in cards). The color will apply consistently in all views where cells from that column appear. SQL Queries . Grist documents are also downloadable SQL databases, in SQLite format. If you download your document (via the button) you can query it using the standard sqlite3 tool (available on the SQLite site ) or from just about any language or database tool. Your tables and columns in Grist will show up exactly as SQLite tables and columns. Here\u2019s a query against the Lead List example document: You may not need to do this often, but when you do it is very handy. We\u2019ve recently improved the fit between SQLite column types and Grist column types, so if a database importer fails to recognize a column, try recreating the column or converting it to a more precise type (e.g. Integer, Text, Numeric, Date, DateTime etc). Learning Grist # Get started quickly with basic Grist concepts by watching this playlist of a few very short introductory videos: Grist Video Series . Each of our featured Examples & Templates has a related tutorial that shows step-by-step how to build it from scratch. Read through one to gain a deeper understanding of how various features play together. Visit our Help Center to find all of the above, along with the full product documentation.

In December, we invited those interested in early access to try the feature out. We\u2019ve made a lot of improvements, and are now excited to open the feature to the public. Things to know about access rules: Until now, everyone you shared a document with saw the same content. Now, their views can be filtered. For example, a table or column may be visible only to certain users. Or some users may see only rows that meet a condition. Until now, all editors and owners of a document could change anything about its content. Now, document owners can control what specific editors can change. For example, a table or column may be locked for certain editors. Or some editors may only update, add, or remove rows that meet a condition. If you need it, editors can be organized into groups or teams using a table within the document itself, and granted permissions systematically. You can make special links to give ad-hoc view access to pieces of the document, including documents shared with the public. Access rules are marked as a Beta feature, meaning that the design of access rules is likely to evolve, and sometimes that will require updates to documents that use them. We won\u2019t make such changes lightly. Grist access rules put great power in your hands. With that power comes great responsibility. Take your time to read our documentation , explore the examples , and test the rules you create . Feel free to reach out to consult us as well, at support@getgrist.com . We\u2019ll be glad to help.","title":"Access rules"},{"location":"newsletters/2021-03/#new-example","text":"Access rules let you control how a shared document is used, and maintain a separation of roles and responsibilities.

You can add a splash of color to a column using the Cell Color option for Columns (in tables) or Fields (in cards). The color will apply consistently in all views where cells from that column appear. SQL Queries . Grist documents are also downloadable SQL databases, in SQLite format. If you download your document (via the button) you can query it using the standard sqlite3 tool (available on the SQLite site ) or from just about any language or database tool. Your tables and columns in Grist will show up exactly as SQLite tables and columns. Here\u2019s a query against the Lead List example document: You may not need to do this often, but when you do it is very handy. We\u2019ve recently improved the fit between SQLite column types and Grist column types, so if a database importer fails to recognize a column, try recreating the column or converting it to a more precise type (e.g. Integer, Text, Numeric, Date, DateTime etc).","title":"Quick Tips"},{"location":"newsletters/2021-03/#learning-grist","text":"Get started quickly with basic Grist concepts by watching this playlist of a few very short introductory videos: Grist Video Series .

Quick Tips # Totals. To compute totals of a column, spreadsheet users will often reach for the last row of their table to enter a formula there. In Grist, every row is a database record, including the last row. But totals are certainly available! Instead of adding a row for totals, add a one-line summary table. Click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button, and select \u201cAdd Widget to Page\u201d. In the dialog that opens, click the summation icon ( ) next to the table you\u2019d like totals for: Click \u201cAdd to Page\u201d, and you\u2019ll see a one-line summary of your table. Use the drag handle just to the left of the title to move it below your table (where you normally expect totals). Grist creates sums of all numeric columns automatically. You can remove any you don\u2019t need, add new ones, or edit ones for which you need something other than sum (perhaps AVERAGE , MAX , or an entirely custom Python calculation). Read Summary tables for more on summary tables and their many uses. Real-time Sharing. Even on the free plan, you can share a document and collaborate on it. Any change that you or another editor makes will immediately show up on the other person\u2019s screen. To share a document, click the sharing icon ( ), and select \u201cManage Users\u201d. In the dialog that opens, type in the email address of the person to invite. Change their role from Viewer to Editor if you\u2019d like to give them editing permission. Then click Confirm. Your collaborator now has access to your document, and Grist will send them an email with a link to it. Read more at Sharing . What\u2019s New # Grist mobile support has come a long way recently, and we are happy to say that you can now use Grist quite comfortably in mobile browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. On small screens, you can find the list of pages from the button in the bottom bar: For pages with multiple widgets, only the active widget is expanded. Other widgets are collapsed until you touch to expand them: To edit a cell, simply double-tap it. Mobile support is still a work in progress. To get back to the desktop version on a mobile device, open your account menu, and select \u201cToggle Mobile Mode\u201d option: Please report any issues, and share suggestions for improvements!

Quick Tips # Entering Formulas. To enter a formula in Grist, simply hit the equal sign ( = ) on the keyboard. To edit an existing formula, hit Enter . Unlike a typical spreadsheet, a Grist formula applies to the whole column, and you can edit this single formula via any of the cells in the column. Read more about formulas . Use Date Picker. If you convert a column to type Date, you\u2019ll be able to enter dates using the date picker interface. To convert a column, open the right-side \u201cColumn\u201d panel, and select \u201cDate\u201d under Column Type: There are options for how to format dates too! See here for more . New Example # In our Task Management article, we share a document similar to what we use internally at Grist Labs to manage our work. This simple document works better for us than any custom software, thanks to the combination of data linking, dropdowns to assign tasks, easy copy-pasting when needed, and live collaboration. And it works just as well in the all-remote work setup, when all our meetings are over video. Find a Consultant, Be a Consultant # Get help building. Many businesses have complex data.

Open Source Announcement # We are happy to announce the beta release of the open source version of Grist ! As a modern, powerful spreadsheet, Grist fits well into the open-source ecosystem, and is as friendly to hacker-developers as to hacker-users. Join the discussion at HackerNews . Read the announcement . This will interest technically-minded users who\u2019d like to extend Grist, or those with unusual requirements. Meanwhile, the service you know and love remains the best supported and cost-efficient option, and will benefit from the increased confidence in Grist source code. Quick Tips # Add a Record. Some of the simplest shortcuts are the most useful. To add a record, press Ctrl + = (Windows) or \u2318 = (Mac). Press Shift at the same time to insert the record above the cursor rather than below. Cook up a Unique Identifier. Let\u2019s say you\u2019d like to refer to records in a table, but don\u2019t have a column that identifies each record uniquely. Perhaps you have people with First_Name and Last_Name , or sessions with Program_Name and Date . To use such tables as a destination of a Reference column, you\u2019ll need a unique identifier. You can create one using a formula that stitches together the fields that identify a record uniquely. For example, create a column Full_Name with the formula $Last_Name + \", \" + $First_Name or a column Session_Name with the formula \"[%s] %s\" % ($Date, $Program_Name) The latter is Python syntax for formatting strings: each occurrence of %s in the quoted string is replaced by a value from the list in parentheses. What\u2019s New # Improved Attachments. The preview of attachments has been vastly improved, and supports showing PDF, video, and audio files. Simply double-click a cell with attachments to preview its content: View Differences. You can now view differences between a copy of a document you make using \u201cWork on a Copy\u201d and the original, as well as what changed since a backup snapshot in the document\u2019s history. Find the \u201cCompare\u201d menu item in the Share menu: This feature is experimental for now, but is already quite useful: This supports the workflow of trying out changes , which should be familiar to users of version control systems such as Git. One of its benefits is allowing view-only users to propose changes, even though they cannot edit the document directly. New Examples # Treasure Hunt : Even better than using Grist for work is using Grist for fun! Check out this template that helps you plan a treasure hunt without losing track. Conspire with relatives or friends online to create a trail of clues, then watch and laugh as the rest of your household flails their way through it.

Quick Tips # Fill a Range. To fill a range of cells with the same value, enter the value in the top cell, then select the range below starting with this cell (which you can do by dragging the mouse, or Shift -clicking the bottom cell), then press Ctrl + D (Windows) or \u2318 D (Mac). Remember it as \u201cD\u201d for filling D own. The usual Copy-Paste shortcuts work too \u2013 Ctrl + C Ctrl + V (Windows) or \u2318 C \u2318 V (Mac). Pasting a value into a larger range will fill the range with multiple copies of the value. Conditional Expressions. If you have a formula like $Birthday.year , you\u2019ll find that when the Birthday column is empty, the formula shows an error. It\u2019s easy to avoid it using Python\u2019s conditional expressions: $Birthday.year if $Birthday else None The same idea can help in other situations, e.g. to avoid a ZeroDivisionError: $Total / $Count if $Count else 0 What\u2019s New # Printing. You can now easily print any widget on your screen, whether a table of data, a card, or a custom widget. Click the three-dots icon on top of the widget, and select \u201cPrint Widget\u201d: Printing also works for special-purpose widgets such as Invoices or Mailing Labels (see below).

Quick Tips # Keyboard Shortcuts. Grist supports many keyboard shortcuts, including quite a few from Excel and Google Sheets. These are listed here , and also available within Grist by pressing F1 or \u2318 / (Mac) or Ctrl + / (Windows). Referenced Columns. With the cursor anywhere in a column of type Reference (used to store a pointer to another record), the Column Options panel on the right has a section called \u201cAdd Referenced Columns\u201d. It allows quickly adding any field from the linked record. If you hit Enter on the added column, you\u2019ll notice that it is simply a formula column, such as $Contact.Email . What\u2019s New # Public Sharing. You can now share your documents publicly. In the \u201cShare\u201d menu ( ) on top, select \u201cManage Users\u201d. Then toggle the dropdown next to \u201cPublic Access\u201d to \u201cOn\u201d: Once you confirm the change, anyone with the link to your document will be able to view it. They don\u2019t even need to have a Grist login. The \u201cCopy Link\u201d button is handy to copy the link to the clipboard for pasting into an email, tweet, or anywhere else. You can also allow anyone with the link to your document to edit it: simply switch the role in the Public Access row to Editor. Note that this allows anyone with the link to change absolutely anything in your document, including deleting all the data. The snapshots in Document History should help if anything goes wrong. Improved Formula Suggestions. While typing in formulas, Grist is now more helpful in suggesting common functions, and includes their parameters, and a link to documentation. New Examples # Here is an example of what you can do with Grist: Tracking Payroll : This template is convenient for small businesses, especially those with part-time employees.

Quick Tips # Date Offsets. It is easy to get into muddles calculating dates. DATEADD is an easy and reliable way to add years, months, weeks, and days to a date. For example, to calculate three months on from a specific date, do DATEADD($date, months=3) . For a week and a day before that, do DATEADD($date, months=3, weeks=-1, day=-1) . Simple! Column Names. Sometimes, there is a tension between choosing a column name as a verbose label to explain what it is about, and choosing something short and snappy that is comfortable in formulas. You can have both! Just open the column options and uncheck \u201c Use Name as ID? \u201d. Then you can set the name used as a label and the name used in formulas separately. And as always with Grist, if you change your mind later you can change or relink the names and all your formulas will update automatically. What\u2019s New # Sort your documents by modification date. You can now choose to order your documents so that the most recently changed ones show up first, using the new By Name / By Date Modified option at the top right of document lists. List documents as icons. You may now also control whether documents show as a grid of icons or as a list of names, using the new grid and stack icons at the top right of document lists. Reactive custom widgets. We have made it simple for web developers to create Custom Widgets that offer new reactive views of your data that update automatically. A developer need only call grist.onRecord(s) to subscribe to a record or a set of records linked to the widget; after that, presentation is a matter of preparing HTML/CSS/JS assets (no Grist-specific knowledge needed). The user of the widget controls data selection using regular Widget Linking . We invite web developers to have a go at building new widgets or visualizations, and we\u2019d be excited to hear about the results (shoot us a mail at support@getgrist.com ). New Examples # Here is an example of what you can do with Grist: Preparing Invoices : Preview printable invoices side by side with your client and order data. Enter billable items quickly, making use of formulas, and see the invoice update immediately just like any other part of a spreadsheet. This is also an example of the kind of new visualization that can be built with Custom Widgets . Learning Grist # Get started quickly with basic Grist concepts by watching this playlist of a few very short introductory videos: Grist Video Series .

To organize a book club is pretty simple. The club will work best if everyone actually gets the book, and has opinions for what to read next time. Grist can help with all that. To nudge the book into everyone\u2019s hands, it helps to have links to borrow the book at your local library, and to buy the book from your local (or not-so-local) store. And for ideas about what to read next time, it helps to be able to easily suggest books, and to learn about books others suggest via sites like GoodReads, Wikipedia, and Amazon. Suppose we start with a simple table of books, with book titles and author names. To borrow or buy the book, it is best to have its unique ISBN code, so there\u2019s no ambiguity or mix-ups. One thing we can do is add a link to search for a book on isbnsearch.org by its title and author. To do this, add a new column, and then set it to be a HyperLink column : What we\u2019re going to do is fill this column using a formula that takes the book title and the author\u2019s name, and uses them as a keyword to search on the isbnsearch.org site. Here\u2019s the formula: import urllib keywords = ($Title or \"\") + \" \" + ($Author or \"\") \"[isbn] https://isbnsearch.org/search?s=\" + urllib.quote(keywords) URLs with spaces or apostrophes or other odd letters you might find in names need special encoding, so we\u2019ve used the python urllib module to make sure everything gets encoded correctly. Now we\u2019ve got a handy [isbn] link beside each book: We can click the arrow by [isbn] , locate the book, and make note of its ISBN code in a new column: Then we can add it into our book list. Now that we have a helping hand for finding ISBNs, let\u2019s add a few more books too: Library and store lookups # Once we have the ISBN, adding a link to buy the book is easy. Here\u2019s a formula for the indiebound.org site, which in the U.S. is likely to have an independent book store near you as a member: \"[buy] https://indiebound.org/book/\" + $ISBN If you don\u2019t have a local bookstore, there\u2019s Amazon, or pretty much any site you like (just find a search page on their site, and match the pattern). import urllib keywords = ($Title or \"\") + \" \" + ($Author or \"\") + \" \" + ($ISBN or \"\") \"[amazon] https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&k=\" + urllib.quote($keywords) The new links look like this: Clicking on the [buy] link near a book now brings us to that book on indiebound.org .

You may also know about \u201cmailto\u201d links that open a mail program to create a new email message. Less well-known is that \u201cmailto\u201d links allow pre-filling many parts of the email message. If you use Grist to store contacts, you can essentially create email templates using Grist formulas. Simple Mailto Links # The simplest \u201cmailto\u201d link in Grist looks like mailto:someone@example.com . When the column is set to Text, and its format is set to Hyperlink, it shows as someone@example.com . If you have a table with columns Full_Name and Email , add another column with this formula: \"Compose Email mailto:%s\" % ($Email) . Set its type to Text, and its cell format to Hyperlink: You\u2019ll get a link in each person\u2019s row, which you can click to start composing an email to that person: See an example of this in action here: Simple Compose . Cc, Bcc, Subject, Body # In addition to opening your email program and filling in the \u201cTO\u201d field, a \u201cmailto\u201d link can fill in other parts of the email, using this format: mailto:<to>?cc=<cc>&bcc=<bcc>&reply-to=<email>&subject=<subject>&body=<body> All fields are optional. You can specify multiple email addresses for To/Cc/Bcc lists by separating them with commas. Values of each field should be percent-encoded , which in Python can be done using urllib.parse.quote . To put this together, this formula will produce a hyperlink to create a pre-filled email: from urllib.parse import quote return \"Compose mailto:%s?cc=sales@example.com&subject=%s&body=%s\" % ( quote($Email), quote($Subject), quote($Body)) A live example of this is here: Advanced Compose . Emailing Multiple People # Email links are very handy when emailing a group of people, such as students in a class, or people on a certain project. For instance, if you have a Reference column \u201cProject\u201d that ties a person to a project, then in the table of projects, you can look up all associated people using lookupRecords . You can then build a link to email them as a group: from urllib.parse import quote people = People.lookupRecords(Project=$id) return \"Email Group mailto:%s\" % quote(\", \".join(people.Email)) You can see this formula at work in Group Compose . Don\u2019t use this to replace an email marketing platform: since emails use your regular email program, you shouldn\u2019t use it for emailing thousands of people. But for small groups, this can be very convenient.

If you are keeping records of who is charged what in Grist, it can be convenient to generate invoices right there and then beside those records. This tutorial shows you how to set up a document like this: You can find a finished template at https://templates.getgrist.com/9NH6D58FmxwP/Invoicing . If you\u2019d like to add invoices to an existing document, making them work the way you want, understanding this tutorial should get you there. Setting up an invoice table # First of all, make a table to record invoices by creating an empty document and renaming Table1 to Invoices : Now, let\u2019s add a widget beside the table to view the finished invoices. There are all sorts of possible styles of invoice, so Grist lets web developers create their own using Custom Widgets. We\u2019ll use an example invoice style published by Grist, but if it doesn\u2019t match your needs any web developer could tweak it for you. Click on Add New , then Add Widget to Page . Then: For Select Widget choose Custom since we\u2019ll be using a Custom Widget. For Select Data choose Invoices since we\u2019ll be viewing data from the invoices table. For Select By choose INVOICES so that the Custom Widget will show data from whatever invoice is currently selected by the user. Great, now we have two widgets, a Table Widget that will have invoice data, and a Custom Widget that will view that data as a nicely formatted, printable invoice. The Custom Widget starts off blank; select Widget options to specify what we want in it: In the CUSTOM settings section where it says Full URL of webpage to show , put this link: https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/invoices/ And set Access to read table . This grants the Custom Widget access to read the Invoices table. Now place anything you like in a row of the Invoices table (I just added the number 1 ). An incomplete invoice will immediately show up: The incomplete invoice shows what column names to use to control what parts of the invoice. An extra black box shows what columns the widget understands, what columns it is ignoring, and what extra columns the widget could make use of. Currently it is saying that it doesn\u2019t recognize any of the columns present, is expecting columns like Number , Client , Items , etc., and is ignoring the default A , B , and C columns in the Invoices table. Looking at the start of the invoice we see a space for an invoice number, INVOICE NUMBER: #Number . So let\u2019s rename the A column to Number , we could leave the value as 1, but then it looks like we haven\u2019t done much business yet. I\u2019m going to choose the set the invoice number to be $id + 51371 , where $id is an auto-incrementing numeric identifier assigned to each row. But you could set it manually or with a different formula. As soon as it is set, the invoice updates: The next column the help box suggests is Client , so let\u2019s rename the B column to Client . Later we will give client information in a structured way, but for now let\u2019s just put some text here (use Shift + Enter to insert line breaks): Great, now the Client box is filled out. The next suggested column is Items , so let\u2019s rename the C column to Items . Later we will give item information in a structured way, but for now let\u2019s just put some text here: And now the Description is set. We\u2019re missing a total, so let\u2019s add a column called Total and set it to 100 : The invoice won\u2019t update immediately. This is the first new column we\u2019ve added - until now we\u2019ve been renaming them. When we created the Custom Widget, it was given access to the columns that existed at the time of creation. To let the widget see the new column, open Widget options again and move Total from Hidden Columns to Visible Columns : Great, the invoice updated. Now let\u2019s set who the invoice is from, by adding an Invoicer column (remember to make it visible to the widget via Widget options ). As a last step to creating a usable invoice, let\u2019s make an Issued column and put today\u2019s date in it (remember to make it visible to the widget via Widget options ). As soon as the invoice has a date, the black help box will disappear: Okay! If someone sent me that, I\u2019d pay it. You should nudge me by giving it a due date though. Let\u2019s make a Due column and set it to a month from the Issued date. Remember to make the Due column visible to the widget via Widget options . Also, be sure to set the Column Type for Issued to Date or you won\u2019t be able to do date math on it (it will just be a string). If there are special instructions to go with the invoice, we can add a Note column. Remember to make it visible to the widget via Widget options . Entering client information # Now, let\u2019s make two useful changes to the invoice set-up: Put client information in a separate table, so we don\u2019t have to reenter their address every time we invoice them (and we can import the addresses in bulk). Enter items and prices in a table, so multi-item invoices are easy to make (and we can use formulas and look-ups for pricing if we like). Before doing so, we need to let Grist know that the content of the invoice will depend on these other tables, so that it can update it when something changes, and make sure the invoice gets access to everything it needs. Make a column named References and give it this formula: = RECORD(rec, expand_refs=1) That says \u201ctake the current record, and package it up, including everything it references directly\u201d. Since Grist is a spreadsheet, it also implies \u201cupdate everything that depends on this column if anything in the references changes\u201d. Remember to make the References column visible to the widget via Widget options , so that the widget will get updated as we add and change referenced material. When the invoice widget sees a column named \u201cReferences\u201d, it fills out the invoice using the \u201cpackaged\u201d values in that column, rather than the individual invoice fields. The benefit will be seen in the next step, since these packaged values can include data from related records. Next let\u2019s place client information in a separate table. Add a new table to the page for entering business information by clicking on Add New , Add Widget to Page , then Select Widget > Table and Select Data > New Table : Then rename the table to Businesses . Let\u2019s also empty the Client column so we can see help about what the widget expects there: The widget suggests Name , Street1 , Street2 , City , State and Zip columns. So let\u2019s provide those columns in our Businesses table, and fill them in for an example client. Then place the same Name in the Client column, and in Column options set the Column Type to Reference . Refer to Businesses Name if Grist doesn\u2019t automatically guess that. Once you hit Apply , you will see a nicely formatted Client section. Entering invoicer information # We could do the same thing for the Invoicer column as we did for the Client column, and make it a reference to the Businesses table or a separate table. However, if you will always be using the same name and address for your business, you could skip setting up a reference by entering a formula like this into the Invoicer column (start typing with = to make it a formula): { \"Name\": \"Thunderous Applause\", \"Street1\": \"6502 Automated Rd\", \"City\": \"New York\", \"State\": \"NY\", \"Zip\": \"10003\", \"Email\": \"applause@thunder.com\", \"Phone\": \"+1-800-YAY-YAYS\", \"Website\": \"applause.com\" } Then set the Column Type for Invoicer to Any in the right-side panel. Notice how emails, phone numbers, and links are specially formatted by the widget. Entering item information # Now, let\u2019s set up the list of items and prices that is at the heart of an invoice. Clear the Items column to see what we can put there. It will show that Items can be a list, where each item has a Description , Price , Quantity , and Total . So we go ahead and add an Items table like we added Businesses , and give it those four columns. We can set Total to be this simple formula: $Price * $Quantity Now we need to pull these items into the Invoices table so that the Custom Widget gets access to them. Set the Items column to the formula Items.lookupRecords() , and then reset its column type to be Any . This formula needs a little more work, which we\u2019ll do soon, but let\u2019s just start with that. Great, our invoice is updating nicely! Remove the Total column to get an automatically calculated one: It is probably more comfortable to edit invoices as a Card Widget than a Table Widget, so let\u2019s change that using Widget options , Table , Change Widget , Card , Save . You can customize the card layout to your taste. To add a new invoice, click the little + above the invoices card, set an Issued date, and pick either the existing Client or add a new one. Once we have a second invoice, it becomes clear we skimped on the formula for collecting invoice items - all the invoices contain all the items. No problem, we can get more specific by adding an Invoice column to Items and setting it up to refer to specific Invoices : Once that is done we can sprinkle on some Grist fairy dust, and go to Widget options for the ITEMS Table Widget, click Change Widget , and set SELECT BY to INVOICES Card . Once that is saved, only the items for the currently selected invoice are shown. Even better, when you add new items, the invoice column is automatically set to the invoice you are viewing. So you can just hide the invoice column and forget about it. Now let the Custom Widget know what items to use by updating the Items formula to be more picky: Items.lookupRecords(Invoice=$id) With that, entering new invoices is a breeze! Click + to add a new invoice card. Pick the client, set the issue date. Add items. Done! Final polish # You can adjust the set-up to taste. For example, I would choose to add new clients on a separate page ( B or Businesses on the left panel) since that is relatively infrequent; you could choose to keep that on the same page. I don\u2019t need deductions or taxes, if you do you could add columns and/or formulas for those. The invoice custom widget works for me as is, but if I needed to tweak anything I could copy the GitHub repository it is in and change it a bit (or hire a web developer to do that for me - they don\u2019t need to be Grist experts). For interested developers, the GitHub code is here: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-widget/tree/master/invoices .

Mais la bonne nouvelle est que vous pouvez rejoindre la communaut\u00e9 de traduction pour nous aider \ud83d\udc4b . If you have employees, then you are keeping track of payroll. You may be using a payroll service, and it probably asks you to enter hours for each employee once a month. This is where Grist can help you keep track of things conveniently, and to reduce mistakes, especially if you have part-time employees. The Payroll Template # The finished template is here: https://templates.getgrist.com/5pHLanQNThxk/Payroll . Feel free to open it in a separate window, and try things yourself as you go along. The template addresses a few needs: We need to be able to add employees, and keep basic contact info for them. We need to set rates at which people are paid, and these rates can change over time. In our example, rates also vary by role: the same person could work as an Instructor in one program, and as a Coordinator in another, at different rates. We need to enter hours for each person. We need to get the monthly totals, both to enter data into our payroll service, and to verify that everything matches. The \u201cPeople\u201d Page # Let\u2019s start with the \u201cPeople\u201d tab in the example. It addresses our needs (1), (2), and (3). On top, we have a list of people, with contact info such as address and phone number. To add a new person, click into the last row of the PEOPLE table, and type in the data. Below that we have a card for the selected person \u2013 a handy way to view or update the selected person\u2019s record. Next to that are the rates for this person. We keep track of all rates, not only the latest one, along with each rate\u2019s effective date. To add a new rate, select a person, click into the last row of the RATES table, and enter the effective date into the Rate Start column (perhaps using the shortcut for today\u2019s date: \u2318 + ; (semicolon) on Mac or Ctrl + ; on Windows). Set the Role that it applies to, and the Hourly Rate . The Comment field is for your own notes. Don\u2019t modify values for existing rates, or past payroll computations will be affected. When you give someone a raise, add it as a new row. This way, full history is preserved, and is available for reference. The \u201cPayroll\u201d Page # To enter payroll hours, switch to the \u201cPayroll\u201d page. It is the most common task, so we placed this page first in the list of pages to have it open by default when you open the document. Scroll to the bottom (you can use these handy shortcuts: \u2318 \u2193 on Mac, Ctrl + \u2193 on Windows). To add a payroll entry, type in the date (or use the date picker), select the person using auto-complete, select their role, and type in their hours. The next few columns automatically look up the relevant rate, and calculate the payment. If you\u2019d like to enter hours for a range of dates, e.g. for a particular week, or for someone working full-time this month, you can use Date as the start date, and enter also an End Date . The interesting bit about this page is how the Per Hour rate is looked up. You don\u2019t need to care if you are just using the template, but if you enjoy looking under the hood, or if you need to customize this further to your needs, I\u2019ll explain it in detail below. The \u201cPay Periods\u201d Page # Here the totals for each period are automatically tallied up to address our need (5) \u2014 to see an overview, to enter data into a payroll system, and to check that everything matches. The latest pay period (in our case, a month) is on top of the top-left table. You can select any pay period there to see a pie chart with an overview of pay broken down by role, and a table of how much each person earned that month. The names and hours in the last table are typically all that a payroll service needs. In addition, we included a Dates column summarizing dates worked that month: for people working part time, it helps remember when the income was earned. It could be a handy note to include into a pay stub if your payroll service allows it. That\u2019s it! We now have a convenient and simple payroll tracker. Under the hood # I promised to show how rates are looked up. Open up the \u201cPayroll\u201d page, click on any cell in the Per Hour column, and hit Enter . The formula you see is an involved Python function, but it is intentionally broken up into bits, with comments explaining what each line does: # Get all the rates for the Person and Role in this row. rates = Rates.lookupRecords(Person=$Person, Role=$Role) # Pick out only those rates whose Rate_Start is on or before this row's Date. past_rates = [r for r in rates if r.Rate_Start <= $Date] # Select the latest of past_rates, i.e. maximum by Rate_Start. current_rate = max(past_rates, key=lambda r: r.Rate_Start) # Return the Hourly_Rate from the relevant Rates record. return current_rate.Hourly_Rate (If this seems too complicated, good luck trying to achieve the same in a traditional spreadsheet!) Read the comments in that code to understand the steps. For those who know Python, it may already make perfect sense. For those who don\u2019t, here are the relevant links to Grist and Python documentation: lookupRecords : how we look up all rates for the given person and role. list comprehensions : how we filter for only those rates with an earlier Rate_Start . max function : how we choose the rate record with the latest Rate_Start . .Field : how we get the Hourly_Rate field from the rate record. This formula is also a good illustration of how helpful it is to have Python available, along with multi-line formulas, variables, and comments. Using the Payroll template # To start using this example for your own payroll, start with the template: GO TO TEMPLATE then click \u201cSave Copy\u201d: Then mark the \u201cAs Template\u201d checkbox. Your copy will then include all the structure, logic, and layouts of the Payroll document with none of the sample data.","title":"Track payroll"},{"location":"examples/2020-09-payroll/#tracking-payroll","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

This is where Grist can help you keep track of things conveniently, and to reduce mistakes, especially if you have part-time employees.","title":"Tracking Payroll"},{"location":"examples/2020-09-payroll/#the-payroll-template","text":"The finished template is here: https://templates.getgrist.com/5pHLanQNThxk/Payroll . Feel free to open it in a separate window, and try things yourself as you go along. The template addresses a few needs: We need to be able to add employees, and keep basic contact info for them. We need to set rates at which people are paid, and these rates can change over time. In our example, rates also vary by role: the same person could work as an Instructor in one program, and as a Coordinator in another, at different rates. We need to enter hours for each person. We need to get the monthly totals, both to enter data into our payroll service, and to verify that everything matches.","title":"The Payroll Template"},{"location":"examples/2020-09-payroll/#the-people-page","text":"Let\u2019s start with the \u201cPeople\u201d tab in the example. It addresses our needs (1), (2), and (3). On top, we have a list of people, with contact info such as address and phone number. To add a new person, click into the last row of the PEOPLE table, and type in the data. Below that we have a card for the selected person \u2013 a handy way to view or update the selected person\u2019s record. Next to that are the rates for this person. We keep track of all rates, not only the latest one, along with each rate\u2019s effective date. To add a new rate, select a person, click into the last row of the RATES table, and enter the effective date into the Rate Start column (perhaps using the shortcut for today\u2019s date: \u2318 + ; (semicolon) on Mac or Ctrl + ; on Windows). Set the Role that it applies to, and the Hourly Rate . The Comment field is for your own notes. Don\u2019t modify values for existing rates, or past payroll computations will be affected. When you give someone a raise, add it as a new row. This way, full history is preserved, and is available for reference.","title":"The \"People\" Page"},{"location":"examples/2020-09-payroll/#the-payroll-page","text":"To enter payroll hours, switch to the \u201cPayroll\u201d page. It is the most common task, so we placed this page first in the list of pages to have it open by default when you open the document. Scroll to the bottom (you can use these handy shortcuts: \u2318 \u2193 on Mac, Ctrl + \u2193 on Windows). To add a payroll entry, type in the date (or use the date picker), select the person using auto-complete, select their role, and type in their hours. The next few columns automatically look up the relevant rate, and calculate the payment. If you\u2019d like to enter hours for a range of dates, e.g. for a particular week, or for someone working full-time this month, you can use Date as the start date, and enter also an End Date . The interesting bit about this page is how the Per Hour rate is looked up. You don\u2019t need to care if you are just using the template, but if you enjoy looking under the hood, or if you need to customize this further to your needs, I\u2019ll explain it in detail below.","title":"The \"Payroll\" Page"},{"location":"examples/2020-09-payroll/#the-pay-periods-page","text":"Here the totals for each period are automatically tallied up to address our need (5) \u2014 to see an overview, to enter data into a payroll system, and to check that everything matches. The latest pay period (in our case, a month) is on top of the top-left table. You can select any pay period there to see a pie chart with an overview of pay broken down by role, and a table of how much each person earned that month. The names and hours in the last table are typically all that a payroll service needs. In addition, we included a Dates column summarizing dates worked that month: for people working part time, it helps remember when the income was earned. It could be a handy note to include into a pay stub if your payroll service allows it. That\u2019s it! We now have a convenient and simple payroll tracker.","title":"The \"Pay Periods\" Page"},{"location":"examples/2020-09-payroll/#under-the-hood","text":"I promised to show how rates are looked up. Open up the \u201cPayroll\u201d page, click on any cell in the Per Hour column, and hit Enter . The formula you see is an involved Python function, but it is intentionally broken up into bits, with comments explaining what each line does: # Get all the rates for the Person and Role in this row. rates = Rates.lookupRecords(Person=$Person, Role=$Role) # Pick out only those rates whose Rate_Start is on or before this row's Date. past_rates = [r for r in rates if r.Rate_Start <= $Date] # Select the latest of past_rates, i.e. maximum by Rate_Start. current_rate = max(past_rates, key=lambda r: r.Rate_Start) # Return the Hourly_Rate from the relevant Rates record. return current_rate.Hourly_Rate (If this seems too complicated, good luck trying to achieve the same in a traditional spreadsheet!) Read the comments in that code to understand the steps. For those who know Python, it may already make perfect sense. For those who don\u2019t, here are the relevant links to Grist and Python documentation: lookupRecords : how we look up all rates for the given person and role. list comprehensions : how we filter for only those rates with an earlier Rate_Start . max function : how we choose the rate record with the latest Rate_Start . .Field : how we get the Hourly_Rate field from the rate record.

The template is at: https://templates.getgrist.com/9nNr9uQwoXWA/Print-Mailing-Labels . You can use it right away. Simply type in your own addresses. The template shows a few variations of what you can do. Labels for a table of addresses # That\u2019s what you see in the first page: You can use the dropdown on top of the labels widget to select the size of the labels, depending on what actual label paper you are planning to print on. What\u2019s actually printed is a hidden column named LabelText . If you show this column, or find it in the \u201cAddresses\u201d page (where it\u2019s visible), you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s a formula that stitches together all the parts of an address. (We get into the details of this formula below.) To print the labels, select \u201cPrint widget\u201d from the menu above the labels widget (see also Printing Notes below): A sheet of labels for the same address # If you need many identical labels, e.g. for a return address, add another column named LabelCount . This is illustrated in the page \u201cLabel Sheets\u201d. If you have multiple addresses in the table, and want to print just one, simply set the count to zero for the addresses you don\u2019t want to include. A filtered list of labels # There are a few ways in which you can print out only a few labels out of a larger table, and these are illustrated in the linked template: The \u201cAddress Labels\u201d page includes a filter button for State , which allows simple filtering by state. You can click + button to easily create additional filters like this: To print out only a few labels out of a larger table, you can use the LabelCount column with a formula. This formula can produce 1 for a label that should be included, or 0 for a label that should not. The page \u201cFiltered By Formula\u201d shows an example, with the simple formula that includes only California addresses: IF($State == \"CA\", 1, 0) : The \u201cFiltered Manually\u201d page includes a Select for Print column.

This example has some hidden columns related to geocoding (the process of automatically calculating coordinates from addresses). You can see these on the second page called Geocoding . They are Geocode , Address , and GeocodedAddress . If you would like to use geocoding, you\u2019ll need these three columns, and to grant the map widget full access to your document so it can store results. Address should hold exactly what you want to pass to the geocoder. In the example, it is simply \", \".join([$City, $State]) . The GeocodedAddress should be left untouched; it is a space for the geocoder to store information. Finally, Geocode is a toggle that should be turned on to automatically generate latitude and longitudes. The geocoder will not touch any rows with Geocode turned off.

In Grist, \u201clink keys\u201d are URL parameters that when combined with the user.LinkKey variable in access rules will determine which data a link recipient is permitted to view. You can learn to do this in four easy steps. We\u2019ve created a simple template you can copy and edit as you follow along with this guide. In our example, you are a private tutor who uses Grist to track hours, payments, and client data. You would like to share session and payment history with parents via a link that only shows their family\u2019s data. A simple way to do that would be to set access rules that limit a link recipient\u2019s view to just those records tied to their family. Let\u2019s do that now. The private tutor can see all data, but a parent can only see their family\u2019s data. Step 1: Create a unique identifier # In the families table, create a new column in which you will use Grist\u2019s UUID() function to generate and assign a unique key to each family. Convert the column to the data column to freeze its values. You\u2019ll notice our formula has changed to a trigger formula. Select \u2018Apply to new records\u2019. This will ensure that new rows will also be assigned a unique identifier. Step 2: Connect UUID to records in other tables # In the Students, Sessions, and Payments tables, add a column that ties each record to the referenced family\u2019s UUID. Name these columns \u201cUUID\u201d, with the simple formula $Family.UUID . Not sure how this works? Brush up on Grist\u2019s powerful reference columns . Tip: The formula $Family.UUID gets the UUID from the record that is referenced in the Family column. Step 3: Create unique links # In the Families table, create a new column in which you will use Grist\u2019s SELF_HYPERLINK() function to generate hyperlinks. Use the formula SELF_HYPERLINK(LinkKey_UUID=$UUID) to create a link key called \u201cUUID\u201d that sets the URL parameter to a specific $UUID within a record. Convert the column type to Text > Hyperlink. How does this work? The link generated for \u201cRaddon, Fin\u201d is .../Private-Tutor-recUUID/p/9?UUID_=6752c258-443d-4a2c-800d-1491da265b72 . The \u201clink key\u201d is the part of the URL that reads ?UUID_=6752c258-443d-4a2c-800d-1491da265b72 . Step 4: Create access rules # Open the Access Rules page from the left panel, and create rules to give limited access to your clients. Let\u2019s think about who should access each table, and which parts of it should be accessible. You, the owner of the document should have full access to Read (R), Update (U), Create (C) and Delete (D) records in each table. Add the rule user.Access in [OWNER] to each table to grant owners full access. Why user.Access ? Review access rule conditions to learn more. Parents viewing the document should have Read-Only access just to those records related to their family. In previous steps, we created a unique identifier (UUID) for each family, connected relevant records in all tables to a UUID, and generated URLs with link keys that include those UUIDs. Now we must create access rules that match UUIDs and URL link keys. To do so, add the rule user.LinkKey.UUID == rec.UUID to each table . This tells Grist to look at the URL\u2019s link key (named UUID) and match it to records that include that same UUID. Set access to Read-Only by clicking on the drop-down menu next to \u201cpermissions\u201d. Make sure Public Access is turned on in the \u201cManage Users\u201d panel (see Sharing ). Tip: Do not edit the default rules. Row-level access is granted in the relevant tables. You did it! This is just the beginning. There\u2019s a lot more you can do with link keys.

In previous steps, we created a unique identifier (UUID) for each family, connected relevant records in all tables to a UUID, and generated URLs with link keys that include those UUIDs. Now we must create access rules that match UUIDs and URL link keys. To do so, add the rule user.LinkKey.UUID == rec.UUID to each table . This tells Grist to look at the URL\u2019s link key (named UUID) and match it to records that include that same UUID. Set access to Read-Only by clicking on the drop-down menu next to \u201cpermissions\u201d. Make sure Public Access is turned on in the \u201cManage Users\u201d panel (see Sharing ). Tip: Do not edit the default rules. Row-level access is granted in the relevant tables. You did it! This is just the beginning. There\u2019s a lot more you can do with link keys. Check out another example to deepen your understanding of link keys even more. Still need help? View the tutorial solution here .

Mastering Reference Columns in 3 Steps # In Grist, reference columns are the key tool to organize relational data. Reference columns tell Grist that two separate tables are related, and specifies which records within those tables are related. For example, if you have a table of Dogs and a table of Dog Owners , you may want each dog\u2019s record to explicitly reference their owner\u2019s record in Dog Owners . Reference columns are a powerful tool for looking up data from a related table, and for creating highly productive layouts. You can learn to do this in three easy steps. We\u2019ve created a simple template you can copy and edit as you follow along with this guide. Using Reference Columns to Organize Related Data # In our example, you are a graphic designer applying for jobs, and you are using Grist to keep track of your job application process. In the template you have four tables: Job Applications , Milestones , Tasks , and Contacts . Your goal is to relate relevant data between tables and create a custom dashboard where you can easily view each job application\u2019s status, and add new job applications and new milestones easily. In this dashboard , clicking on each job application shows only the milestones related to that job application. We can create this relationship using reference columns. Let\u2019s create this dashboard together. Step 1: Creating References # Reference columns are a type of column available under COLUMN TYPE. It is helpful to think of the table with the reference column as the referencing table , and the table which is being referenced as the underlying table . Converting Columns with Text into Reference Columns # If you already have text in the selected column, set the COLUMN TYPE in the right-side panel to \u201cReference\u201d. Grist will guess the underlying table and column you want to show in the reference column. You can review and edit this guess and set the appropriate underlying table and display column. DATA FROM TABLE points to the underlying table. SHOW COLUMN sets the display value in the reference column. For example, in the Milestones table, convert the Role column into a reference column. DATA FROM TABLE should point to Job Applications . SHOW COLUMN should be set to Role . Note that the reference column is referencing the entire record and you are choosing which column to display in the reference column. Tip: You can easily identify reference columns by the chain link icons in the column\u2019s cells. Creating Reference Columns # In the Contacts table we have a list of contacts that are not associated with any job application or company. Let\u2019s create a new column called Company , set its type to Reference, and point to Job Applications as the underlying table with Company as the display in the reference column. Click on the empty cell to open a drop-down menu and manually select the company at which each contact works. Look at the email address for a hint. Note: You can always click on a Reference Column cell to open the drop-down menu and select a new value. Step 2: Look up additional data in the referenced record # Recall that the reference column is referencing another table, and correlating two specific records. Although you see a specific column in the display of the reference column, the reference is being made to the entire record . This allows us to look up additional data fields in the related record using a simple formula. Let\u2019s try it. In step 1, in the Milestones table we created a reference column called Role . It would be useful to also see for each Milestone record, the relevant company. For example, in row 1 we see the Milestone event \u201cRejected!\u201d for the role \u201cHead of Digital Design\u201d. It is not immediately apparent which company this is. Let\u2019s use the Role reference column to easily look up the company listed in the \u201cHead of Digital Design\u201d record in the Job Applications table. To do so we create a column called Company and we use the formula $Role.Company . The formula structure is $[Reference Column ID in Referencing Table].[Column ID in Underlying Table] . Grist will also auto-complete parts of the formula as you type it. There\u2019s an alternative way to add multiple columns from an underlying table. If you\u2019re interested in learning more, visit our website\u2019s help section on reference columns . Step 3: Create a Highly Productive Layout with Linked Tables # One of the most powerful features of Grist is the ability to link related tables in the same page to create highly productive layouts. In the final dashboard shown at the start of this tutorial, we saw that clicking on a job application would populate a view of milestones related to that job application. Let\u2019s do that now by adding Milestones as a widget to the Job Applications page. ( Brush up on widgets here .) Adding the table as a Card List widget makes the data easier to view. Similarly, you may want to change the Job Applications table to a Card List widget. In the CARD LIST menu on the right, select DATA to set data selection rules. Under SELECT BY you will see the option \u201cJOB_APPLICATIONS Card List\u201d. This option is only available because in step 1 we created a reference from the Milestones table to the Job Applications table in the Role reference column. This reference tells Grist which milestones are related to which job applications. Congrats! You now know how to use reference columns to organize related data, give your data structure, and create linked widgets in productive layouts. If you\u2019d like, compare your document to the tutorial solution . Dig Deeper: Combining formulas and reference columns. # If you\u2019re comfortable with formulas, try using formulas in reference columns to make Grist an even more powerful tool. In the tutorial solution , we\u2019ve used a formula to do more. The formula in the Last Milestone field in the Job Applications widget is looking up the most recent date in related records in the Milestones table. Thus, adding a new milestone with a more recent date would automatically update this field. You can learn more about lookup formulas on our website . Because Last Milestone is both a formula column and a reference column, we\u2019ve also done the following which follows the formula described in step 2 of this tutorial. The Status field uses the formula $Last_Milestone.Round to look up the related milestone\u2019s round status. The Updated On field uses the formula $Last_Milestone.Date to look up the related milestone\u2019s date. By doing this, status and date also auto-update when the Last Milestone field updates.

Mastering Summary Tables with 2 Concepts # In Grist, summary tables are the workhorse of data analysis. They are similar to pivot tables in spreadsheets, and group-by functions in databases. They make it possible to summarize tables by grouping records into specific categories. For example, if you have a table of Olympic champions, it may be useful to group champion records by country or by sport \u2014 or by a combination of country and sport. Once records are sorted into useful categories, you may then want to compute sums using those record groups. Grist makes use of a nifty special field, available in formulas as $group . Summary tables make it easy to build pages in which you can quickly capture useful data insights. You can learn to do this by learning two concepts: creating summary tables, and using $group in formulas. We\u2019ve created a simple template ( https://public.getgrist.com/x527ESJATWNS/Time-Sheets-Tutorial ) that you can copy and edit as you follow along with this guide. Using Summary Tables to Analyze Data # In our example, you work for the HR department of a candy factory that hires contractors that work for various departments. In the template, your team has created an advanced time sheet tracker. There is a page where contractors can easily add time sheets for select months. It would be useful to have additional pages that summarize expenses by month, by department, and by contractor. Your goal in this tutorial is to build those summary pages. Creating Summary Tables # Step 1: Create a summary table # Let\u2019s start by creating a summary table that groups records in the time sheet table by month. Grist makes it easy to create summary tables. Simply click on Add New > Add Page > Time Sheet Entries > > Months . Doing so will generate a summary table with some columns. In this case we have the following three columns. First Column: List of month groups, January through June of 2021. Second Column: A count of the total number of records in each month, e.g. in January there are 12 time sheet records. Third Column: A sum of hours worked in each month, e.g. in January the total hours worked in those 12 time sheet records is 81 hours. Note: Grist will automatically take any numerical columns and add them up, saving you some time. Step 2: Create summary tables with multiple categories # It may be useful to also group timesheets by a combination of categories. For example, we may want to know how much time and money was spent on a particular account in a particular month, or on a specific employee in an specific account and month. When creating a summary table, you can select multiple columns by which to group data. Let\u2019s add two new summary tables. When adding these widgets, be sure to Select By the first widget we created on this page. This will link the tables so that selecting a month in the first widget will dynamically update records in the new widgets. Not sure why? Brush up on linking widgets . Add New > Add Widget to Page > Time Sheet Entries > > Months and Account Add New > Add Widget to Page > Time Sheet Entries > > Months and Account and Employee To more easily view this data, drag and drop the new tables so that they tile vertically. You may also want to hide the count columns. Great! But now we want to add the total dollar spend in each of these categories. That\u2019s simple to do with summary formulas. Calculating Totals Using Summary Formulas # Following along with the video? Visit the tutorial solution if you get stuck. Note that there are access rules in place for the tutorial solution which will prevent you from seeing certain pages and most data. Make a copy to become the document owner and see all data and pages. Step 1: Understanding $group field in formulas # In Grist, $group is a special Python object that represents a collection of records that are summarized by the current summary line. If you look at the formula in the Hours Worked column, you will see SUM($group.Hours_Worked) . That is taking the sum of Hours Worked in a group . In this example, in row 1, the group is January 2021. Thus, in that row, the formula is adding hours worked in the January 2021 group. In row 2, the group is February 2021 and the formula sums hours worked in February. If you take a peek at the count column, which we hid previously, you\u2019ll find the formula len($group) . The function len (which stands for length) counts all the records that belong to the group being summarized in a particular row. Another way to express a set of records is by scanning through the list of records in a group using a variable. You can name the variable as you wish; we will use r (for \u201crecord\u201d). We can rewrite the formula in Hours Worked as sum(r.Hours_Worked for r in $group) . Step 2: Using $group in formulas # Let\u2019s calculate the total dollar spend on hours worked in each month. The formula is sum(r.Hours_Worked * r.TimeSheet.Hourly_Rate for r in $group) . Since each record r in the group is a record in the underlying table ( Time Sheet Entries ), r.Hours_Worked refers to the field in that table. In the Time Sheet Entries table, the column TimeSheet is a reference column that is referencing an entire record in the Time Sheets table. Thus, we have to further specify which field from the referenced record should be included in the formula\u2019s calculation, which in this case is Hourly_Rate . To learn more about reference columns, visit our Reference column guide . We can apply the same formula to the other two summary tables on this page. In the second table, the $group function is grouping things in the same month AND account. In the third table, the $group function is grouping expenses in the same month AND account AND by the same employee. And that\u2019s it! You did it. You rebuilt the month summary page. See if you can apply these concepts to rebuild the contractor summary page. Did you know? If needed, you can also add conditions to this formula. For example, sum(r.Hours_Worked * r.TimeSheet.Hourly_Rate for r in $group if r.Hours_Worked > 0) will only add up records in which there is a positive value in the field Hours Worked .

It is sometimes useful to know when a record was last updated or created, and by whom. Grist makes it simple to create columns that stamp the time or a user\u2019s name to a record when it is updated or created. This makes it possible to sort records by age, determine how long a record has existed, or quickly track the most recent edit to its author. This is especially useful when working in a team. Suppose you have a document tracking sales opportunities. It may be useful to know the last time a sales person took action on a particular opportunity, and further determine for how long that opportunity has been pending.

Creating Time Stamp Columns # Columns can stamp the time when a record was created or updated by using the NOW() formula. Let\u2019s add a column to the Tasks table to track when a task was last updated. This can be accomplished in three steps. In the Tasks table, create a column labeled \u2018Last Updated\u2019 and in column types, select DateTime to select your desired format for date and time . Convert the column to a data column by clicking the ACTIONS dropdown in the creator panel. This prevents the formula from triggering whenever the document loads. Once converted to a data column, enter the NOW() formula. You will see two checkbox options below the formula. Apply to new records triggers the formula only when a record is created. Apply on record changes triggers the formula when a record is updated. Select Apply on record changes to open a submenu where you may select which fields, when updated, will trigger the formula. In this case, we\u2019ll select Any Field which means that updating any field in this record will trigger the time stamp formula to update. Great! You are now tracking when a task was last updated. Next, you may want to know who created a task because that person may have the most information about the task\u2019s goals and parameters. That\u2019s just as simple to create in Grist as time stamps. Creating User Stamp Columns # User stamps are created using the exact same steps as time stamps, expect for one detail \u2014 the formula is user.Name . Let\u2019s add a column to the Tasks table to track who created a task. In the Tasks table, create a column labeled \u2018Created By\u2019 and in column types, select Text and modify the format if you wish. Convert formula column to a data column and enter the user.Name formula. Select Apply to new records so that the formula only triggers when a new record is created. There are other possibilities available in addition to user.Name such as user.Email or a unique user.UserID . The user information available is the same as that in access rule conditions . Note. It is still possible for a user to manually edit cells with time stamp or user stamp formulas. If you don\u2019t want that to be allowed, use access rules to forbid it. And that\u2019s it! You\u2019ve created columns that capture user and time stamp information based on specific triggers, such as when a record is updated or created. Great job! Dig Deeper: Combining time and user stamps using formulas # Typically it is best practice to keep time and user stamp information in separate columns so that you may later sort and filter by those columns. However, there may be times when it would be useful to capture both time and user stamp information in the same column. Let\u2019s add such a column to the Applications table. In the Applications table, create a column labeled \u2018Created At\u2019 and convert to a data column. In column types, select Text. Enter the formula \"{:%b %d, %Y} by {}\".format(NOW(), user.Name) . The part in quotes is a format string. Each set of curly brackets {} in it gets replaced with the next value in parentheses after .format . Note that the format of the date is set within the corresponding {} . The format is set with a colon : followed by the specific Python codes %b , %d , %Y . Here is a table summarizing all the date format options available in Python .

It is sometimes useful to know when a record was last updated or created, and by whom. Grist makes it simple to create columns that stamp the time or a user\u2019s name to a record when it is updated or created. This makes it possible to sort records by age, determine how long a record has existed, or quickly track the most recent edit to its author. This is especially useful when working in a team. Suppose you have a document tracking sales opportunities. It may be useful to know the last time a sales person took action on a particular opportunity, and further determine for how long that opportunity has been pending.

If you are keeping business details and contracts in Grist, it can be convenient to generate proposals and contracts right there, alongside those records. You can use the Markdown Custom Widget to create a custom \u2018form\u2019 for Proposals, Contracts, or many other types of documents. This tutorial shows you how to set up a document like this: You can find a finished template here: \ud83d\udcdd Proposals & Contracts Template . If you\u2019d like to add a proposal to an existing document, understanding this tutorial should get you there. Setting up a Project table # First of all, make a table to record project details by creating an empty document and renaming Table1 to Projects : We\u2019ll create our Proposal template alongside our Projects table. We can insert column IDs as placeholders in our Proposal template that will then be replaced by the cell value for the selected project. For example, in the screenshot below, the value in the Project Name column will replace the variable {Project_Name} in the proposal template on the right. Seeing the available columns while creating our proposal will make it easier to populate those variables. Creating templates # Let\u2019s add a new table, Templates , to the page to store our template data. Add two columns: Name and Template Formatting . Now, let\u2019s add a custom widget beside the table to view our Template Formatting . Click the green \u2018Add New\u2019 button then \u2018Add widget to page\u2019. Under \u2018Select Widget\u2019, select \u2018Custom\u2019 and under \u2018Select Data\u2019, select Templates . Under \u2018Select By\u2019, select Templates again. Configure the custom widget by selecting \u2018Markdown\u2019 from the \u2018Custom\u2019 dropdown. Since we will be editing the template directly in the custom widget, you must allow \u2018Full document access\u2019 under Access Level so the widget can update the Templates table. Under \u2018Content\u2019, select the column Template Formatting . This is the column that will be updated when we make edits within the custom widget. Create a Template in the Templates table by entering a value in the Name column. Then, start editing the template formatting within the custom widget. The widget uses Markdown formatting to format the text. For help on Markdown, click the ? at the top of the widget to view the Markdown Guide . When you click the \u2018save\u2019 icon, formatting from the widget will populate the Template Formatting column. We will exclusively use the custom widget to edit the template formatting so this column can be hidden from the table view. To hide the column, right-click on the column header then \u2018Hide column\u2019. In your template, you\u2019ll have details and text that remain the same across all projects such as formatting, section headers and your own company\u2019s information. That is the information you\u2019ll type directly into the template. You\u2019ll also have information that changes, such as Project Name or Customer Name . We can use variables containing column IDs as placeholders for that dynamic data. Project Name , Customer Name and Customer Address will all change based on the selected Project. So, this is information we should store in our Projects table. Add the columns Project Name , Customer Name and Customer Address to the Projects table. We can use the column IDs for each of these columns as placeholders in our template with the format {COLUMN_ID} . A column\u2019s ID can be found under the \u2018Table\u2019 tab of the Creator Panel, directly under the Column Label. Finish building out your template to fit your needs. Be sure to add a column to your Projects table for all variable information. Finally, we need to add a formula column that will create our unique proposals. This formula column will combine the template formatting we just created with our project-specifc data. Add a new column to the Projects table with the following formula: # Finds all data associated with this record class Find_Data(dict): def __missing__(self, key): return getattr(rec, key) # Finds the \"Proposal\" template in the Templates table template = Templates.lookupOne(Name=\"Proposal\").Template_Formatting # Formats the template with fields from this table as well as fields from the referenced table template.format_map(Find_Data()) Setting up a proposal dashboard # Next, we\u2019ll want to populate our proposal template with actual project data! Start creating a Proposal Dashboard by adding a new page to your document. Click the green \u2018Add New\u2019 button then \u2018Add Page\u2019. Under \u2018Select Widget\u2019, select \u2018Table\u2019 and under \u2018Select Data\u2019, select Projects . You\u2019ll notice that having this information in a table view is a bit busy. A Card widget will help simplify our view. Add a new widget to the page by clicking the green \u2018Add New\u2019 button then \u2018Add widget to page\u2019. Under \u2018Select Widget\u2019, select \u2018Card\u2019 and under \u2018Select Data\u2019, select Projects . Under \u2018Select By\u2019, select Projects and add to page. Your dashboard should look similar to the screenshot below. Now that we have all of our Project details in a Card view, we can hide them from our table view. Under the \u2018Table\u2019 tab of the Creator Panel, select all columns except Project Name and Customer Name then click the green \u2018Hide Columns\u2019 button. Keeping most project details in the Card widget, rather than the Table widget, simplifies our dashboard. You can easily see all projects in the Table widget, and when you want to see details for a specific project, select the project and the Card widget will update to show you project details. Finally, we\u2019ll want to add a view of our project-specific proposal. Add a new custom widget to the page by clicking the green \u2018Add New\u2019 button then \u2018Add widget to page\u2019. Under \u2018Select Widget\u2019, select \u2018Custom\u2019 and under \u2018Select Data\u2019, select Projects . Under \u2018Select By\u2019, select Projects and add to page. Configure the custom widget by selecting \u2018Markdown\u2019 from the \u2018Custom\u2019 dropdown. You must allow \u2018Full document access\u2019. Under \u2018Content\u2019, select the column Proposal . This is the formula column that combines our template formatting with our project-specific data. Customize your layout by rearranging and resizing widgets. Add project details for a new project and see how your proposal updates to display the newly added data. Entering customer information # Now, let\u2019s make two useful changes to the Project set-up: Put customer information in a separate table, so we don\u2019t have to re-enter their address every time we create a proposal for them (and we can import the addresses in bulk). Update the formula in the Proposal column of the Projects table to look for information in another table. First, create a new table called Customers for customer-specific information like Name and Address . Some of this data is included in our Projects data set. To avoid duplicating data, we need to update our Customer Name and Customer Address columns to pull from our Customers table. On our Proposals Dashboard page, select the Customer Name field then update the column type to Reference . Confirm that \u2018Data from Table\u2019 is set to Customers and \u2018Show Column\u2019 is Name . Next, we need to update the Customer Address field to pull the address for the customer listed in the Customer Name column. Update the Customer Address column to use the following formula: $Customer_Name.Address This formula uses our reference column, Customer , along with dot notation , to pull the value from the Address column of the referenced table. When you take a look at a proposal for an existing project, you\u2019ll notice that the Customer Name no longer populates. This is because of the way reference columns store data. Although under \u2018Show Column\u2019, we chose to see the value from the Name column of the referenced table, reference columns actually store a record\u2019s ID. That is what we are seeing now in the proposal. We can modify our formula in the Proposal column to look for data in other tables. In the Projects table, update the formula in the Proposals column to the following: # Finds all data associated with this record class Find_Data(dict): def __missing__(self, key): return getattr(rec, key) # Finds the \"Proposal\" template in the Templates table template = Templates.lookupOne(Name=\"Proposal\").Template_Formatting # Formats the template with fields from this table as well as fields from the referenced table template.format_map(Find_Data( Customer_Name = $Customer_Name.Name, )) In the last portion of the formula, we can specify variables that pull from other tables. Customer_Name = $Customer_Name.Name is for our reference column, Customer Name . It uses dot notation to specify what data to pull from the referenced table. Note: Customer Address The Customer Address column can be deleted from the Projects table completely. This data is already stored in the Customers table and our Customer Name column is a reference column pointing to this table. We can use this reference column to pull any other information from the Customers table to include in our proposal. If you choose to delete Customer Address from the Projects table, update the last section of formula to the following: template.format_map(Find_data( Customer_Name = $Customer_Name.Name, Customer_Address = $Customer_Name.Address.replace('\\n', '<br>'), )) This tells the formula what to use in place of the variable {Customer_Address} . Printing and Saving # Once your proposal is ready to go, you can print it or save it as a PDF. Click the three-dot icon at the upper-right of the widget then select \u2018Print widget\u2019. From here, you can either select a printer or choose \u2018Save as PDF\u2019 from the \u2018Destination\u2019 dropdown. Setting up multiple forms # You can add more form templates by following the same steps that we have just completed. Add a new template to the Templates table then build out the template using variables containing column IDs for any data that is project-specific. If you have some sections that are the same as another form, copy it over to save yourself the trouble of retyping! Create a dashboard where you can select a project and enter details for this form then preview the form in a custom widget. Don\u2019t forget, you\u2019ll need to add a formula column that combines the new form template with details for the selected project! This formula column is what you\u2019ll select under the \u2018Content\u2019 dropdown while configuring the Markdown Custom Widget .","title":"Proposals & contracts"},{"location":"examples/2023-07-proposals-contracts/#creating-proposals","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

Update the formula in the Proposal column of the Projects table to look for information in another table. First, create a new table called Customers for customer-specific information like Name and Address . Some of this data is included in our Projects data set. To avoid duplicating data, we need to update our Customer Name and Customer Address columns to pull from our Customers table. On our Proposals Dashboard page, select the Customer Name field then update the column type to Reference . Confirm that \u2018Data from Table\u2019 is set to Customers and \u2018Show Column\u2019 is Name . Next, we need to update the Customer Address field to pull the address for the customer listed in the Customer Name column. Update the Customer Address column to use the following formula: $Customer_Name.Address This formula uses our reference column, Customer , along with dot notation , to pull the value from the Address column of the referenced table. When you take a look at a proposal for an existing project, you\u2019ll notice that the Customer Name no longer populates. This is because of the way reference columns store data. Although under \u2018Show Column\u2019, we chose to see the value from the Name column of the referenced table, reference columns actually store a record\u2019s ID. That is what we are seeing now in the proposal. We can modify our formula in the Proposal column to look for data in other tables. In the Projects table, update the formula in the Proposals column to the following: # Finds all data associated with this record class Find_Data(dict): def __missing__(self, key): return getattr(rec, key) # Finds the \"Proposal\" template in the Templates table template = Templates.lookupOne(Name=\"Proposal\").Template_Formatting # Formats the template with fields from this table as well as fields from the referenced table template.format_map(Find_Data( Customer_Name = $Customer_Name.Name, )) In the last portion of the formula, we can specify variables that pull from other tables. Customer_Name = $Customer_Name.Name is for our reference column, Customer Name . It uses dot notation to specify what data to pull from the referenced table. Note: Customer Address The Customer Address column can be deleted from the Projects table completely. This data is already stored in the Customers table and our Customer Name column is a reference column pointing to this table. We can use this reference column to pull any other information from the Customers table to include in our proposal. If you choose to delete Customer Address from the Projects table, update the last section of formula to the following: template.format_map(Find_data( Customer_Name = $Customer_Name.Name, Customer_Address = $Customer_Name.Address.replace('\\n', '<br>'), )) This tells the formula what to use in place of the variable {Customer_Address} .","title":"Entering customer information"},{"location":"examples/2023-07-proposals-contracts/#printing-and-saving","text":"Once your proposal is ready to go, you can print it or save it as a PDF.

To help you assess whether Grist will work for a use-case you have in mind, here is a list of limitations that apply to its operation. Number of documents # On all plans, the number of documents is not limited. To prevent accidental abuse of the system by automation tools, team sites may be limited to 1,000 documents. If you encounter such a limit for legitimate use, please contact support to increase it. Older free plans had a limit of ten documents. Learn more about legacy limits . Number of collaborators # For team sites on all plans, there is no limit on the number of team members that may be added to the site. For paid plans, the number of team members determines the price. See our pricing page for details. Team members added to your team site may inherit access to workspaces or documents within that organization. Learn more about team sharing . On both personal and team sites, each document may be shared with up to 2 free guests who do not affect the plan price even on paid plans. Number of tables per document # There is a limit of 500 tables allowed per document. This is a soft limit. If you find yourself with a large number of tables, consider merging ones that have the same structure. For example, if you have a table for each product type, consider using a single table with the product type as an extra column. Rows per document # On the Free plan, documents have a limit of 5,000 rows. The limit for Pro and Business plans is 100,000 and 150,000 rows, respectively. Documents are also subject to data size limits, as described below. Data size # There is a hard limit to a document\u2019s total data size, determined as the row limit multiplied by 2KB. This means that documents on the Free plan have a data size limit of 10MB, with Pro and Business plan documents having limits of 200MB and 300MB, respectively. This value corresponds approximately to the size of the data in CSV format. You can see a document\u2019s current data size on the \u2018Raw Data\u2019 page . For memory and performance reasons, there\u2019s a recommended data size limit of 20MB. Documents beyond 20MB may slow down or run into memory limits depending on their complexity. As an example, a document with 100,000 rows and 24 numeric columns would reach this recommended limit. To help optimize formulas on large documents, you can use the built-in formula timer . Attachments are counted separately. Attachments plus data in a single document are limited to 1GB on all plans. Uploads # Uploads are limited to 50MB, both for attachments and to import data. Note that an import within this limit may result in a document that exceeds the document size limit, in which case the upload is still likely to fail. API limits # Free plans are limited to 5,000 API calls per document per day. Pro and Business plans raise the limit to 40,000 and 60,000 calls per document per day, respectively. Free plans may be rate limited to 5 API requests per second per document. The team plan does not impose such a rate limit. Separately, there is a concurrency limit of 10 for all plans: if 10 authorized API requests are currently being processed for a particular document, any other API requests will be rejected (with HTTP status code 429) until at least one of the original requests completes. A client that waits for one request to complete before sending the next would not hit this limit (assuming it is the sole client accessing the document). The size of the body of any individual API request is limited to 1MB. In particular, this means that requests adding or updating multiple records may need to be split into batches that fit within this limit. Document availability # From time to time, during upgrades and operational transitions, individual Grist documents may become inaccessible for a period of some seconds. Please bear this in mind when using Grist\u2019s API.

It is important to keep your Grist installation up to date .","title":"Self-Managed Grist"},{"location":"browser-support/","text":"Browser Support # Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !

Bar Chart # This is a classic chart type , where the values in a column are shown as the heights of a series of rectangles. Column # A column is a vertical series of cells in a table. Columns in Grist have names. Each cell in a column is in a different row. When data from a column is present within a card, we call it a field. When a table of data is represented as a chart, we refer to each column as a series. From a data modeling perspective, columns typically have data about a single aspect of many real world entities, whereas rows have data about many aspects of a single entity. Column Options # Every column\u2019s appearance and behavior can be customized by clicking on the column header, clicking on the drop-down, and selecting \u201cColumn Options\u201d. Column Type # Columns have types, which control the appearance of cells in that column and the method used to edit them. You can change the column type at will. The Text Column Type is suited to strings of any length; the Date Column Type is specialized for storing and editing calendar dates; the Reference Column Type is for storing and editing links to other tables; the Numeric Column Type is for any kind of number; etc. Creator Panel # The creator panel is the right-side menu of configuration options for widgets and columns. Dashboard # A dashboard is just another name for a page, typically organized to give a summary or overview of a document\u2019s data. Grist is well suited to constructing dashboards, by creating pages with suitably linked widgets . Data Table # Data is stored in tables. Tables have named columns , and a sequence of rows containing values for those columns. Every row has a numeric id (available as $id in formulas) that is unique within that table. The raw data page lists all data tables in your document. Document # A Grist document is a collection of related data. If you work with databases, think of it as a single database. If you work with spreadsheets, think of it as a single spreadsheet. Like databases and spreadsheets, the data in a Grist document is organized as a set of tables. How this data is viewed and edited is unusually flexible. Grist documents are organized visually into pages. Pages contain widgets that offer different ways to view and edit tables. To work with Grist, the first step is typically to create a document . Drag handle # This is an icon to facilitate reorganizing views or lists visually. On a desktop computer, when hovering over a drag handle, the mouse cursor changes. The drag handle for a widget is just to the left of the widget\u2019s title. There is an example of using this drag handle in the investment research demo . Fiddle mode # Fiddle mode is a special mode that some Grist documents, such as the ones from the Examples & Templates page , will open in. A document opened in fiddle mode will have a \u201cfiddle\u201d label next to the document title in the top bar. In fiddle mode, any edit to a document will cause a new, unsaved copy (a.k.a \u201cfork\u201d) of that document to be created; the original document will remain unaffected. The copy can be saved via the \u201cSave Copy\u201d button or menu option. You can add /m/fork to the end of any document\u2019s URL to make that document open in fiddle mode (e.g. https://public.getgrist.com/3NsoHE2mWtEp/Lead-list/m/fork ). Field # A field is a column shown in a Card Widget. The terms column, field, and series are not different in substance, but are different terms that make more sense for different widgets. In a Table Widget, we talk about columns. In a Chart Widget, we talk about series. And in a Card Widget, we talk about fields. A field has layout properties that are meaningful within a Card, but would not be meaningful in other contexts. Import # To import into Grist means to take data from other sources (on your computer or on the internet) and place that data in a Grist document. Examples of importing include: Take a CSV file on your computer, and create a Grist document with the same content (see: start a new Grist document ). Take an Excel file on your computer, and add the data from it to an existing Grist document (see: importing more data ). Take a JSON file on the internet, and add the data from it to an existing Grist document (see: importing more data ). Calling Grist\u2019s API from a program and adding data read from another source (see: Grist API ). Lookups # Lookup formulas allow you to \u201clook up\u201d data in other tables. lookupOne allows you to look up a single record in another table by matching some data across two tables, similar to Excel\u2019s VLOOKUP. lookupRecords allows you to look up multiple records in another table by matching some data across two tables. Lookups can be combined with dot notation to pull data from referenced records. Learn how. Page # Grist documents are organized visually into pages. Each page allows you to view or edit one or more tables. The nature of these viewers and editors (called \u201cpage widgets\u201d) is flexible, as is their layout. A single table can be viewed (or edited) from multiple widgets in one or many pages. And a single page can contain widgets for viewing (or editing) many tables. Pages are listed in the document ( in the panel on the left ). In this list, they may be rearranged and grouped, with several \u201csubpages\u201d nested within a single page. Pie Chart # This is a classic chart type , where a circle is sliced up according to values in a column. Record # A record is the data in one row of a table, comprising the data in the individual cells of that row. It has a unique identifier, usually hidden but available in formulas as id . In a Card Widget or a Card List Widget, a record is represented by a single card. Row # A horizontal series of cells in a table. Each cell in a row belongs to a different column. The data stored in a row is also called a record. Typically rows have data about different aspects a single entity, whereas columns have data about a single aspect of many entities. Series # Data from a single column shown in a Chart Widget is called a series. The same data in a Card Widget is called a field, and in a Table Widget is called a column. Sort # The order in which rows of a table are shown is called the sort order. An example of changing the sort order of a table is given in the CRM tutorial . Trigger Formulas # A trigger formula is a formula that recalculates your data based on a set of conditions that you decide. They also allow you to clean data when a new value is entered ( watch webinar ), provide a sensible default value for a column or create Time and Authorship stamps . User Menu # The user menu is the menu that opens by clicking your profile icon in the top-right of Grist. From there you can manage your profile, add additional Grist accounts that you own, and see a list of team sites to which you have access. Depending on where you are, the user menu will contain additional options. For example, from a personal site you\u2019ll see the option to upgrade your plan to a team site . From a team site, depending on your role and permissions, you may be able to manage billing or edit team members . From a document, you\u2019ll find an option to edit document settings. Widget # A page contains sections, such as table grids or charts, which we call \u201cpage widgets\u201d. They are used for viewing or editing data in tables. Types of page widgets include Card Widgets , Chart Widgets , as well as the classic spreadsheet-style table grid (called a Table Widget ). Widget Options # Every page widget can have its appearance and behavior customized. How this is done varies between widget, but can always be done systematically by clicking on the three-dot menu on the top right of a widget and selecting \u201cWidget options\u201d. Wrap Text # Normally, content that doesn\u2019t fit in the width of a cell is truncated, with \u201c\u2026\u201d indicating that part of the data is hidden. When \u201cWrap Text\u201d setting is enabled, long lines will wrap, and the cell will get taller to include all content. An example of wrapping is given in the CRM tutorial .","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#glossary","text":"Warning Nous commen\u00e7ons tout juste \u00e0 traduire la documentation pour cette langue, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 !
